Well unfortunately for you, you are now a kid named Bill, and he has nightmares.\r\n\r\nIn Nightmare is an atmospheric stealth horror game in the likes of Limbo and Little Nightmares, but in third person isometric view. A mix of puzzle solving and exploration, as well as a bit narrative driven, in a psychological sense.\r\n\r\nThe whole game is set in Bill’s nightmares while in a coma, across all the nightmarish renditions of the past traumas of this seemingly troubled kid. Alongside him is a glowing butterfly spirit companion that you can use to look ahead and scout locations and detect enemies. A simple mechanic that is complementary to the game’s limited vision due to its isometric view.\r\n\r\nIn Nightmare is full of puzzles, and for me it's the game’s best feature. Most of them are well made and they come in all shapes and sizes. I didn’t find anything too hard and most of them, while mildly diffic",

Such as instead of just killing a character, a certain character needs to perform the task. Sometimes, the objective is riddle-like, not clear and specific, further adding to the puzzle solving aspect.\r\n",

Six weapons all at once, all attacking simultaneously. That’s the basic gist of Brotato. For those familiar with the game Vampire Survivors, Brotato is essentially a welcome clone. Both are in the same genre of bullet-hell survival one handed roguelite games, but the two games couldn’t be more different from each othe",

Miss too many notes and the run will fail, but the progression is still recorded if it's a new high score.\r\n\r\nRizline’s rhythm game mechanics is easy to learn and only requires two fingers from each hand to use and tap the screen.

Players take control of Shovel Knight or nine other playable characters with their own abilities, navigating them on an 8x8 grid where they can move up, down, left or right. As enemies and blocks descend from above and fill the grid, players must strategically move and attack to clear them. Failure to defeat an enemy results in the player receiving damage equivalent to the enemy's offensive strength. Movement by one unit instantly drops the ",

Elements like constructing sawmills or quarries to gather resources from the environment, building housing to accommodate the growing population, and establishing barracks to train and recruit troops. Players will also need to manage the quality of the air by constructing filters, adding another survival element. These addictive and staple elements are seamlessly combined with frantic defense building and tower defense actions where you build walls, defense, and traps with a clever lego-style system that is equally as engaging as the town building aspect.\r\n\r\nI played the demo, which consisted of the first two missions of the game. The first level, while slowly and methodically introducing the game mechanics, is a huge misstep in providing a proper first impression.

In this ravaged world, humanity faces the relentless onslaught of otherworldly beings known as the Ethereal, who emerge from enigmatic portals called Hollows. These formidable creatures have wreaked havoc, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. However, a resilient group of survivors has formed New Eridu, a bastion against the Ethereal threat. Their survival hinges on extracting technology and resources from their enigmatic foes. ZZZ is expected for release on PC and mobile, but that’s not all, as the game was also announced for consoles during the on-going Tokyo Game Show this year.\r\n\r\nZZZ was recently showcased during this year's Tokyo Game Show alongside other HoYoverse games, with its own 20-minute segment.

Well, the game promises to be an immersive interactive narrative experience that will test your wit and determination. Is it? Does it?\r\n\r\nSad to say, but it's not --- and it doesn't.  The game falls flat as a video game experience; the gameplay is very shallow: just move, run, and jump, and even with that simple scheme the character is awful to control. The game is very short under 40 minutes and there's really no challenge nor compelling reason to play it.\r\n\r\nWhat's nice though is the hand drawn art style and the pro-environmental message it conveys. However this could have been done easily with a short series of videos instead. Having said all that, the game is completely free-to-play, no in-game ads or purchases, so the intent is really noble, just wasn't executed very well as a video game.\r\n\r\n[Original link](https://www.taptap.io",

Little Nightmares is a 3D puzzle-platformer that plunges players into a surreal and atmospheric world.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Tarsier Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, it was originally released last 2017 for PC and Consoles. While we got a mobile spin-off in the form of Very Little Nightmares last 2019 (in which I also reviewed), it was really not the same 3D experience it’s big little brother had. Finally, we now have an official mobile port for the actual Little Nightmares and it’s more or less captures the same experience, just translated to touch controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Subtle, beautiful, narrative experience\r\n\r\n- Dark, foreboding environments and haunting character designs\r\n\r\n- A tense and varied gameplay experience\r\n\r\n- Well-designed puzzles a",
