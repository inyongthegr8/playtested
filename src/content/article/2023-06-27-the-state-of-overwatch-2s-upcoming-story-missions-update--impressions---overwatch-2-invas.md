Set to launch on August 10, 2023, Overwatch 2: Invasion will transport players back into the heart of the action-packed narrative of Overwatch 2, immersing them in thrilling PvE story missions against the formidable forces of Null Sector.

The update will introduce three exhilarating missions set in iconic global locations. Heroes will be pitted against the relentless onslaught of Null Sector in the sprawling streets of Rio de Janeiro, the bustling metropolis of Toronto, and the enchanting city of Gothenburg. Each mission promises huge maps, intricate objectives, and an immersive storyline that will keep players on the edge of their seats. I'm personally excited for this as the lore for Overwatch is actually interested in itself, especially if you have watched the animated shorts for Overwatch before.

Aside from the story missions, there's a new bonus co-op event on King's Row, as well as a new PVP core game mode called Flashpoint, in which teams will engage in frantic battles to secure control over strategic locations known as "flashpoints," with the objective of capturing at least three of them. Not only that, but the update also features changes to the training and practice game modes, even going as far as offering leaderboards to those looking to master its training courses.

In conjunction with the Story Missions update, Blizzard is offering the Overwatch 2: Invasion Bundle, allowing players to dive headfirst into the gripping narrative and PvE action for $15 USD. This bundle includes access to the Story Missions during the season and permanently thereafter, along with 1,000 Overwatch Coins, a new Legendary skin for Sojourn, and permanent access to Sojourn as a playable hero upon completing Story Mission challenges. 1,000 Overwatch coins is valued at around $10 in itself, so basically you’d be getting the rest of the content for just $5.

For those seeking an even more comprehensive experience, the Overwatch 2: Ultimate Invasion Bundle is available for $40 USD. This bundle includes all the content of the Invasion Bundle, as well as additional bonuses like the Null Sector Premium Battle Pass with 20 Battle Pass skips, an extra 1,000 Overwatch Coins, and two legendary skins for Cassidy and Kiriko.

Overwatch 2: Invasion is set to launch on August 10, 2023. However, not everyone is pleased with the recent announcement. Just a few weeks ago, it was revealed that the original PvE vision for Overwatch 2, which planned to include proper hero progression, talent trees, and high replayability, has been effectively canceled. Instead, Overwatch 2: Invasion will introduce a more straightforward story missions co-op mode for an additional price tag.
