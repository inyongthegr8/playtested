Gget ready to embark on an epic journey into the post-apocalyptic metropolis of New Eridu! Zenless Zone Zero's Closed Beta Test (CBT) sign-up is officially live, and this is your chance to dive into the urban fantasy world filled with action and intrigue.

Zenless Zone Zero Equalizing Test

The sign-up period end date and the actual dates for the CBT are yet to be announced, so don't miss your opportunity to still sign-up and be a part of this testing phase. It's a limited account with no payment required, and please note that data will be deleted after the test.

The sign-ups going live also coincide with the release of another Teaser Trailer, which showcases more of ZZZ. It offers a glimpse into the game's vibrant world, showcasing a variety of elements. From the plethora of intelligent Bangboos, originally designed to aid residents during Hollow disasters but now serving as vital helpers, to the action-packed combat move sets and dazzling skill animations of some of the characters, the teaser promises a visually stunning and engaging third person hack and slash ARPG.

Moreover, the trailer provides a peek into the slice-of-life aspects of the game, with scenes featuring noodle restaurants and arcade game stores. At the end of the teaser is a glimpse of a powerful, female-like entity with pink tentacles and spikes, potentially hinting at a formidable boss battle (or character?) awaiting players in New Eridu.

Soon you'll step into the shoes of a Proxy and explore the treacherous Hollows. For supported platforms, you can participate in the CBT on PC, Android, or iOS. While it was announced a while back that it will also come on Consoles, it will not be a part of the CBT for now, at least with the current announcements.

CBT Game Requirements:

PC:
7th Gen Intel Core i5
8GB RAM
Nvidia GeForce GTX 970

iOS:
iPhone XS or iPad A12
4GB RAM (Please note that Mac is currently unsupported)
