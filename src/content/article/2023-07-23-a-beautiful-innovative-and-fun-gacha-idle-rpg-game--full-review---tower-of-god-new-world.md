Tower of God: NEW WORLD

Tower of God: New World is an upcoming mobile idle RPG game, based on the original Webtoon Tower of God created by S.I.U. This mobile game retells the story of Twenty Fifth Bam's quest to find his friend Rachel within the mysterious Tower, while inserting the playerâ€™s journey into the fold. As players traverse the Tower, they encounter newfound allies who aid them in their journey.


**Pros:**


+Faithful story retelling while also telling a new story

+Best-in-class mobile game visuals

+Three voice-over options, with the original Anime Japanese actors returning

+Refreshing gameplay mechanics


**Cons:**


-Departure from the original manhwa art style

Playable in vertical mode, Tower of God: New World features stunning and clean cel-shaded anime-esque graphics that are on-par or even better with some of the best looking mobile titles out there like Genshin Impact. The characters and backgrounds are beautifully designed, even the abilities of characters are accompanied by unique animated cutscenes, which adds extra to the presentation, at least in the first few bits before the novelty wears off and you turn off the cutscene option.

Sound wise, fans will be delighted to hear that the original Japanese voice actors for the anime are returning in this game In addition, Tower of God: New World includes the option to switch between Japanese, English, and Korean voice-overs, accommodating players with different language preferences, which is pretty uncommon in mobile games.

Some fans of the original Webtoon might not appreciate the anime-zation of the game and departure from the original manhwa art style, some characters are redesigned or made to look more anime-like. Nevertheless, the visual quality of the game overall is impressive and does justice to the source material.

In Tower of God: New World, players assume the role of a new character inserted into the narrative, following Bam's footsteps and experiencing the adventure firsthand. The game introduces a new player-named character, along with his navigator and tutorial guide Rin, bridging the gameplay mechanics with the overarching storyline. Through Rin's guidance, players become an integral part of the Tower's world, forging their path, and interacting with iconic characters.

The plot is divided into two parts: the current plot, which revolves around the player-created character's journey through the Tower, and the story mode, which allows the character to access and relive the memories of Bam. This means that players not only embark on their unique adventure but also have the opportunity to relive and retell the events of the original Webtoon in a summarized but informative manner.

The gameplay involves team building, choosing the right party members, and utilizing materials to level up character slots, and weapons to progress through the Tower and Story. The game also features a gacha system where players can summon characters from the Tower of God universe, including iconic characters from the original Webtoon.

As an idle game, Tower of God: New World doesn't require players to actively engage in combat, except for optionally choosing when to utilize ultimate skills. The primary focus lies in team building and selecting the appropriate team members depending on the enemy.

The characters are classified into different roles and elements, akin to a rock-paper-scissors type of interaction. Leveraging elemental strengths can be advantageous, dealing double damage to opponents, while weaker elements result in halved damage.

A notable feature is the Shinsu Link mechanic with the character slots, replacing traditional character leveling. Players level up Shinsu Links tied to the formation and deployment of their party members. This refreshing system provides the freedom to freely team build without concerns about investing too much in individual character levels and without much penalty for swapping characters with newly acquired ones. Overall the gameplay feels smooth and polished, and I have encountered no bugs or even performance issues with the game. The combat is satisfying to watch, and the quality of life brought forth by the Shinsu Link mechanic reduces a lot of potential grind.

The game offers numerous ways to develop and customize characters. Alongside the usual itemization system for different character types, there's the Limit Break feature that enhances a character's skills. To do this, players need to obtain duplicates of specific characters to obtain the necessary materials. Furthermore, the Proficiency and Rapport systems boost a character's stats, providing even more depth to character progression.

Tower of God: New World impresses with its diverse array of game modes, offering something for everyone. The Story Mode successfully retells the Tower of God narrative, engaging players with its intriguing plotline. The Adventure Mode stands out as players climb floor after floor, defeating enemies to ascend higher in the Tower. The Expedition section encompasses various modes like Trail Area, Arena, Conquest Mode, and Battle Facility. All in all keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Like many mobile games, Tower of God: New World incorporates a gacha system where players can summon characters from the Tower of God universe. The option to hand-pick five characters from the SSR pool with a rate up is a significant bonus, which makes it easier to target and acquire these coveted characters. Additionally, the SSR pity system, triggered after 100 pulls, allows players to select and obtain an SSR character from the banner. After 200 pulls, players receive an SSR+ bonus, granting them a chance to change the summoned character if it's not their desired choice.

Conclusion:
Tower of God: New World's visually impressive graphics, fluid animations, and commendable voice acting, coupled with a dual narrative system, all create pleasing artistic experience. Gameplay wise, it offers a refreshing and customizable quality experience with innovative mechanics, diverse game modes, and pretty forgiving gacha mechanics. Set for a global release this coming July 26, Tower of God: New World is a highly promising game that caters to both avid fans of the series and newcomers to the Tower of God universe.
