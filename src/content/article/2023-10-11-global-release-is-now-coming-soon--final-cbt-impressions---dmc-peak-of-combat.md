title: 'Global Release is now coming soon | Final CBT Impressions - DMC: Peak of Combat'

When I previewed the game back a few months ago, I touted it as a game that stays true to its roots gameplay wise. Well, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat continues to uphold the core hack-and-slash gameplay style that the series is renowned for.

The game is now coming soon globally, and as per the information provided in the iOS store listing, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is expected to have a worldwide release scheduled for December 2, 2023.

Taking a page from its gacha contemporaries, the game also allows players to seamlessly switch between three selected characters during combat. This mechanic encourages creativity and strategy in battles, and enhances the combo system and makes it more dynamic, compensating for the streamlined and simplified touch controlled combat, which feels responsive and satisfying to partake in. It even rates your combos, from D to SSS (stylish).

It manages to maintain the essence of the franchise, offering players an opportunity to indulge in the exhilarating combat experience on their mobile devices,  BUT with a polarizing gacha direction. Not everyone appreciates this change, and, in my opinion, this simple transition fundamentally alters the entire paradigm of the game, and, in my view, not for the better.

Iâ€™ve noticed that significant grinding is need required to make progress in the game even as early as the first chapter, as well as the inclusion of a stamina system called pizza to severely limit play. These grind-heavy progression systems have a direct impact on combat and overall enjoyment, as enemies become excessively challenging unless players invest considerable time in grinding or resort to spending real money.

Of course, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is way different from the mainline games that DMC fans are used to, where they are treated to a typical one-time game purchase to access most, if not all of the content without any pressure to spend additional money for in-game progression
