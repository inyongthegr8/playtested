Bright Reappear is an intriguing fusion of the popular Candy Crush match-three puzzle system and retro-style turn-based RPG gameplay. While these both addicting genres have rarely been combined in the past, this game brings its own unique twists to the table.

Bright Reappear features six playable hero characters, with two heroes: “Warrior” and “Thieves”' already unlocked from the start. Each of them have their own distinct talents and skills that are affected by the match-three combat style system. I was able to play the demo version before, and this game is mostly the same with minor changes, only now with complete 12 chapters divided into levels and featuring up to 50 different enemies and bosses..

The core gameplay of Bright Reappear revolves around matching four icons: sword, book, potion, and gold. By strategically matching these icons in groups of three or more during battles, players trigger corresponding actions such as attacking, healing, earning gold coins, defending, or gaining additional moves. The mechanics of match-three games naturally lead to combos, and Bright Reappear is no exception. Whether intentionally planned or haphazardly made, combos unleash powerful combo attacks and impressive moves enacted by player character, resulting in flash action-packed moments.

Additionally, Bright Reappear introduces innovative twists to the match-three formula, offering players the freedom to move multiple pieces simultaneously,  depending if they have enough action points. These multi-piece moves, restricted to the same direction, provide a dynamic and fast-paced gameplay experience, setting it apart from traditional match-three games. Additionally, the strategic element is further enhanced by the freedom to move pieces without much repercussions aside from spreading negative effects on icons, even when no three-matches are immediately available, allow the player to the stage for bigger and more rewarding combinations. Despite an unlimited number of moves, players must carefully manage their characters' health points, as well as the spreading negative effects, while facing relentless enemy attacks, adding a layer of tactical decision-making to the gameplay.

The overall feel of the game feels incredibly satisfying as far as match-three gaming is concerned. Considering its affordable price, I would say that it is definitely worth a try. Bright Reappear was released on June 21, 2023, and is available on Taptap for $1.99. Additionally, a separate free demo is available for players to try as well.
