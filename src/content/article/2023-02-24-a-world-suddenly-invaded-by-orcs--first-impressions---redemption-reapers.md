Redemption Reapers is a dark fantasy RPG game that promises a gripping story and a challenging turn-based tactics gameplay.

The story is about a world suddenly invaded by orc/goblin-like creatures called the Mort and it's up to our band, Sarah and the disreputable extremely outnumbered Ashen Hawk Brigade, to wage guerilla warfare against the forces of Mort. Your party is composed of five playable characters, skilled warriors each with their own contradicting personalities and backstories. All of which come into play into this intriguing family dynamic.

Redemption Reapers offers three control schemes, keyboard, mouse-driven, and controller support. While these options are nice to have, they can be unconventional, and it may take some time to get used to them. Quality of life shortcuts and hotkeys could have been added to make the control schemes more intuitive.

The graphics and presentation aren’t really a strong point of this game, even the CGI is a bit below average and looks like something from the early 2000s. However, its strong points are in the gameplay and the narrative.

The game and story are divided into multiple missions that you can clear by completing the objective — where in some circumstances you have a choice on what to do, maybe just passing through is enough, maybe you need to wipe all of them, or maybe you need to save someone. Aside from enemies, you will also encounter loot and collectible relics scattered.

In between the missions, you can customize your characters’ skills, items and purchase items from the merchant. You can also “train” your character to further level them up. Each character has their own weapon type to equip, and these weapons break in time, requiring repairs and replacements.

Combat of Redemption Reapers is highly tactical, Your group is extremely outnumbered and it's up to you and your tactics to ensure victory over the enemies.

The skills and effects that each of the characters have in their arsenal synergize very well. The progression element of unlocking new types of skills that can turn the tide in battle is a rewarding experience. It encourages ingenious and clever combinations of skills and smart positioning to beat the enemies that heavily outnumbers your team.

Constantly changing your strategy and adaptation to what the game throws at you is a fun element that is challenging, compelling to do, and gratifying to pull off.

The presentation and price could have been better, but so far, Redemption Reapers has gotten my attention and I’m liking the initial experience. The combat is compelling, and the story feels like I’m watching a fun new dark fantasy anime series.
