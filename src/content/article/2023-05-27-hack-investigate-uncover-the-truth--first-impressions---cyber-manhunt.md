Cyber Manhunt is a PC hacking-themed game that has recently made its way onto the Android platform, offering players an immersive experience as they step into the shoes of a skilled hacker, recently hired by a corporation. I was able to test a trial version of the game, and play the prologue plus the first mission.

The main gameplay is set in the OS of the computer itself: opening applications, and browsing around the simulated internet of the game. At its core, Cyber Manhunt provides players with a range of hacking-related activities to undertake. Starting with web searches and browsing to collect basic information about targets, players can then utilize a comprehensive database to gain deeper insights about persons of interest.

A cracking software to discover and exploit passwords to access various accounts across different platforms. Hijacking social network and email accounts, requiring players to engage in email threads, conversations, and even phone calls with targets while

maintaining a disguise and utilizing gathered information to build trust.

The whole setup is really streamlined, offering a casual yet still challenging and somewhat accurate depiction. The process of discovering information, such as usernames, emails, and passwords, and using them on apps is simply done through a drag-and-drop operation. There is no need for typing or excessive guesswork involved. However, for individuals well-versed in hacking, a certain suspension of disbelief is still necessary.

The look and design of most of the software, websites, and articles in Cyber Manhunt are meticulously crafted to closely resemble their real-life counterparts, effectively immersing the player in an authentic cyber world. This attention to detail not only adds to the visual appeal of the game but also enhances the overall immersion, believability, and ease of use of the hacking experience. Still, I feel that the game doesn’t have enough filler content or red herring to provide an even more immersive experience, a common gripe I have with these types of games.

At the end of cases, you can infer findings based on the evidence you acquire, and you are given choices on what to deduce. However, the significance of these choices is somewhat undermined because if you select the wrong option, it results in no immediate consequence until you eventually choose the correct one. The game only gives you an illusion of choice.

Cyber Manhunt’s translation from PC to mobile touch controls are serviceable, but there are occasions where I had minor control difficulties in navigating the UI clearly designed for mouse with its small font, text boxes, and buttons.
