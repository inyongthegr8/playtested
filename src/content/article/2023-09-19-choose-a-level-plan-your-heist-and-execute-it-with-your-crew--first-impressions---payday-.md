PAYDAY 3 continues that tradition of delivering classic cooperative heist experiences, allowing players to plan and execute elaborate robberies with friends.  The game is set to be released on September 21, 2023 for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.

The core gameplay of PAYDAY 3 remains faithful to the series formula that fans know and love. You choose a level, plan your heist, and execute it with your crew, all while dealing with waves of law enforcement and security forces. It's the kind of cooperative experience that can lead to intense moments of strategy and action, and PAYDAY 3 is nothing short of that experience.

There are noticeable improvements coming from PAYDAY 1 and 2. The now Call of Duty-esque gunplay feel responsive, and the weapons pack a satisfying punch. Stealth is more viable now, but are more difficult the ever. Heists are bigger and better. There are unlimited zip ties now that you can use, encouraging the use of hostages instead of going all out war all the time.

Character progression wise, PAYDAY 3 introduces a notable shift in the skill system compared to its predecessor. Instead of the Skill Tree, the game adopts “Skill Lines”. This streamlined approach simplifies skill progression, featuring a base node, upgrade nodes, and a Mastery Node. Players can unlock the base skill and choose their desired upgrades without a predetermined linear path.

So far, PAYDAY 3 is undeniably fun, especially when played cooperatively, but its quirks and missed opportunities prevent it from being a proper evolution of the series. It's a game that provides excitement and thrills, but one that also leaves room for improvement in the future.
