We have another point-and-click puzzle game ported to the mobile platform yet again with Boxville. I’ve just played the demo and it immediately places you right after the beginning of the game. To avoid spoilers, there is no plot or backstory presented, but the world is inhabited by tin-can like humanoid beings living in cute cardboard boxes resembling into a somewhat peaceful city.

Looking at the full game’s non-spoiler synopsis though, the main premise is about trying to find your dog after losing it in an earthquake. This same earthquake heavily affected the city of Boxville, setting the stage for all the environmental puzzles and character challenges that will hinder you in your search.

While the characters can seemingly mumble talk with each other, they mostly communicate — especially to the player — through different modes of signs, either through gestures or via flash cards. The highly detailed hand drawn environments in conjunction with the chill soundtrack is highly mesmerizing and relaxing, to the point that I actually fell asleep while trying to play through the demo. The game is not boring per se, just highly relaxing.

During the demo I encountered pretty formidable puzzles that are mostly logical in nature, it just requires the power of observation and critical thinking. The whole gameplay loop is about solving different environmental puzzles in order to progress to the next area. Gather items in the environment, solve puzzles that will lead to more items or unlock new sections to explore, ultimately leading to the next area where the cycle begins anew.

This game is clearly designed for pinpoint accurate mouse control and the mobile touch controls haven't really translated well to the gameplay. Some elements are very small or are too close together that you will constantly mistouch stuff, sending your character into the wrong interaction or exiting your puzzle because you accidentally touched the sides of the phone. However, it is a passable control scheme and one that gets better anyway with time and practice.

Boxville is a relaxing but challenging short adventure that will leave you wanting for more. An artsy modern point-and-click experience. The full game is relatively short, around two hours long only, way less if you are fast at solving the puzzles.
