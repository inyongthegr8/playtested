Assassin's Creed Mirage is a "coming-of-age story," for Basim starts as a street thief and grows into a Hidden One under the guidance of his mentor, Roshan. True to the series' tradition, the game features historical figures from the 9th-century Baghdad. The game does away with mythologies and magic, and features a more grounded tone this time around. The story is now much shorted this time, around just 1/4 of the length of the previous game.

It's set to release on iOS for iPhone 15 Pro and Ipad M1+ models in early 2024, with the recent release last October 5, 2023 for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.

Assassin's Creed Mirage aims to recapture the essence of earlier Assassin's Creed titles, placing a stronger emphasis on linear storytelling and stealth gameplay than recent RPG-focused entries. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth remain at the core of the gameplay. The game is even being marketed as a "return to the series' roots"

However, the return to the series' roots is a gradual process. While it has shed many RPG elements, such as XP leveling and number-based damage systems, it hasn't fully recaptured the classic Assassin's Creed feel. The parkour system, for instance, feels largely unchanged, lacking the grace and fluidity seen in earlier titles. The also combat still retains some elements from Assassin's Creed Valhalla ableit also stripped down to a bare minimum that is arguably the weakest combat system that I've seen in an Assassin's Creed game.

Well, there's still work to be done to fully recapture the classic feel of the series, but Assassin's Creed Mirage is definitely a step in the right direction for the series, embracing its roots by focusing on stealth, assassination, and linear storytelling.

As said earlier, the game is also coming to mobile devices, and I can't wait to replay this game on Apple mobile phones and tablets, to see what it's going to be like performance and visuals-wise.
