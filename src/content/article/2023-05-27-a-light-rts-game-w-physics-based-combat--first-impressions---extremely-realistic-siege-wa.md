With its physics-based combat, humorous tone, and challenging scenarios, Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator offers a combination of strategy, puzzle solving, and sandbox entertainment. Prepare to build your army, construct siege equipment, and lead epic battles in this medieval world of strategic conquest. Originally a PC game (which is still in Early Access on Steam), I was able to play the Android demo version of Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator, which is coming soon.

Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is essentially a real-time strategy game, where players can deploy units, command them in battle, and even assume control of them via third person view. The main focus of the game is siege warfare, and puts players on siege missions against a variety of AI defended fortresses.

In the demo version Iâ€™ve played, it offered a set of single player tutorial missions that introduce players to different scenarios and map layouts. Each mission focuses on teaching players specific gameplay mechanics or strategies, such as using ladders, building platforms, activating soldier abilities, or conducting full-blown sieges. This approach allows players to gradually learn and familiarize themselves with the game's mechanics while experiencing a taste of the addicting puzzle-solving and strategic decision-making.

The depth of strategy in Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is simple but dynamic thanks to its physics based system. Each scenario and map layout presents unique challenges that require careful planning and tactical decision-making, made unpredictable by the physics system. Whether it's utilizing siege equipment, stacking platforms on top of each other to create a backdoor entry, coordinating unit movements, or exploiting enemy weaknesses, the game offers a wide range of strategic options. The ability to directly control soldiers in third-person mode adds a layer of immersion and personalization to the gameplay.

The blend of puzzle-like scenarios and strategic decision-making keeps players engaged, while the physics-based combat injects a sense of fun and unpredictability. With further improvements to the controls, Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator has the potential to become a standout in the physics-based warfare simulator genre.
