title: Retro Top-Down Roguelite Shooter and Waifus | First Impressions - Burst Space
---

Released on Android, currently only for the Philippines region, Burst Space introduces players to intense bullet-hell like battles, abilities experimentation, and the opportunity to collect and customize their waifu Einherjar warriors.

The overarching objective is to rescue the Einherjar from each planet and harness their power to conquer bosses, unlock equipment, and further enhance the characters' skills and abilities. Burst Space also features free-to-play elements like battle passes, events, and premium Einherjar, offering players the option to personalize and extend their gameplay experience using the power of real money.

At its core, Burst Space thrives on experimentation and customization. While not as intricate as some of its roguelite counterparts, the game encourages players to explore various skills, abilities, and upgrades to optimize their approach. Burst Space embraces player creativity by offering a multitude of choices, especially in longer levels where there are more choices, ensuring that the gameplay experience remains engaging and dynamic. The depth of gameplay isn't solely confined to individual runs though, as the character's true power level lies in the progression system outside of battles.

As players advance through the levels, they acquire equipment, weapons, and accessories, adding more Einherjar to the available roster. Skill customization and weapon mastery upgrades contribute to character growth, allowing for personalized play styles and strategies. Burst Space's progression system strikes a balance between depth and accessibility, providing a rewarding sense of advancement and mastery.
