‚ú®Release Date and Overview
Call of Duty: Mobile Season 9 ‚Äî Graveyard Shift is scheduled to launch on October 4 at 5 PM PT. This season promises a slew of engaging content, including the return of fan-favorite modes and the usual seasonal array of rewards to entice players.

üßüZombies Classic and Undead Siege

One of the biggest highlights is the return of both Zombies Classic and Undead Siege modes, both from past seasons. Zombies Classic was first introduced way back in November 2019, taking inspiration from the popular Zombie modes in the mainline games, while Undead Siege was introduced in 2021. These game modes have come and gone throughout the years and were not necessarily limited to Halloween periods.

Zombies Classic:
Enter the classic round-based game mode set in Shi No Numa, also known as the Swamp of Death. Work with your squad to fend off the undead horde, growing more formidable with each round. Earn points to unlock new pathways, purchase Perks, and strengthen your arsenal with items from the Mystery Box.

Undead Siege:
Drop into a zombified version of the Battle Royale map Isolated and cooperate with teammates to survive for five days and nights. Collect supplies during the day and prepare for intense battles against hordes of zombies at night. Set up defensive turrets and maintain the teleporter to secure your survival.
