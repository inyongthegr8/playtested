Pocket Playfest: An Indie Celebration 2023 Winter Edition

In a recent hands-on exclusive experience this past weekend, I had the privilege of testing a handful of titles on TapTap's experimental cloud gaming service, setting the stage for this 16-day event where indie game developers show-off their creations exclusively on the TapTap mobile platform â€” fully playable PC games without the need for an actual PC, Android/iOS version, or the need to download the games and install them.  Granted, youâ€™d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.

Futuristic colors? check. sci-fi energy weapons? check. Rogue-lite elements? Low-fi vibrant visuals? check. A featured game on Pocket Playfest, Core Devourer is an upcoming game that looks really close to Risk of Rain 2 with its low-poly style 3D environment with a stylized and somewhat cel-shaded aesthetic. Then taken apart mechanically and put back in a Vampire Survivors suit.

The game is a twin-stick arena shooter where you clear the open map of all robots and bosses. The primary objective is to confront colossal hordes of droids, absorb their cores, and ascend as the most potent cybernetic entity on the planet.  The game features procedurally generated maps, with randomized power-up choices gained from killing enemies and gathering EXP.

Overall, the combat is challenging, fun, and encourages experimentation, and I am very excited to see how the final product will play out, being a huge fan of both Risk of Rain 2 and Vampire Survivors. A demo is currently available on Steam, free for everyone to try. Seriously, that demo alone can be satisfying to play for hours already.
