Detective Mimo
9.4
Puzzle
Singleplayer

Detective Mimo is a charming and self-aware detective game that's perfect for fans of mystery and adventure games with a nice touch of fourth wall breaking. The game follows the titular detective cat Mimo as she solves crimes around town, and it's up to the player to help him piece together the clues and catch the culprit.

The gameplay in Detective Mimo is a classic point-and-click adventure style in touch format, with players tapping on different areas of the screen to investigate crime scenes, gather and use objects, and solving puzzles. You can talk to some NPCs to give you some information and interact with the environment using a variety of novel ways not only involving the touch screen, but also involving many aspects of your mobile phones like using its gyro sensors, light detection, charging, and even gameplay elements literally outside the game.

The game starts off in a usual classic adventure, with the player taking on the role of cat Mimo, who is a police detective. She is tasked to capture a notorious robber, a cat named ‘Cat Rogue’, Cat Rogue’ has announced his next heist and Mimo is sent to the Bank to investigate. The first hour or so functions like a normal classic adventure detective game, but suddenly shifts in tone towards a fourth-wall breaking, somewhat creepy game, and that kind of reminds me of Doki Doki Literature Club!, for those that are familiar.

The experience is fun and constantly subverts the players’ expectations with regards to the gameplay and the plot. The actual puzzle gameplay which is the main highlight of the game, is challenging enough and gives players a varied number of unique puzzles to complete. As said earlier, it may require out of the box thinking. You may need to actually visit a website or two to progress in the game, or perhaps use your phones in ways you didn’t really expect. Of course, finding these things out and discovering them for yourself is part of the fun.

Overall, Detective Mimo is a point-and-click detective game that challenges traditional forms of storytelling and invites the players to participate in the narrative in a unique and memorable way. It's a great choice for fans of mystery games, adventure games, or just anyone who wants to help a lovable cat detective solve crimes, sprinkled with some mind-bending twists.
