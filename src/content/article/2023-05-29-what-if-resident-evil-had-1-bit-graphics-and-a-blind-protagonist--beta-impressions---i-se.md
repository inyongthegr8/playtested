I See You is a narratively-driven adventure game where players assume the role of a blind man in search of his missing girlfriend. Games that delve into unique perspectives and disabilities can offer a fresh and immersive experience, and this particular game leverages blindness as a gameplay mechanic.

The game features a striking 1-bit graphical style complemented by a straightforward gameplay. Movement is done through the touch joystick, while interactions with objects are handled via the right portion of the touch screen. The visually impaired-focused gameplay adds a layer of challenge and tension, as players cannot see far ahead and must stick to walls, objects, in order to make sense of the environment. Auditory signals like ringing phones or doorbells coupled with visual indications constantly provide references to their respective locations, heightening immersion within the perspective of the blind protagonist.

I See You embraces gameplay elements inspired by the Resident Evil series, while combining 1-bit graphics with visually impaired-focused mechanics. Save points take the form of typewriters, while puzzle-solving involves collecting various items such as keys and components to craft more complex objects like batteries or handgun ammunition.

My experience was limited to a short portion of the game, and it should be noted that the game is still a work in progress. Unfortunately, there were constant crashes during item pickups, which hindered my ability to thoroughly enjoy even the beta test. Nevertheless, the game shows promise, particularly with its novel visually impaired mechanics in 1 bit style format. The combination of survival horror elements with this unique perspective creates a genuinely new experience.
