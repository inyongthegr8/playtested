Exolotl : Zian
8.0
Adventure
Action RPG

Exolotl : Zian that takes players on an exciting retro platformer adventure to save the Exolotl Planet from the clutches of the nefarious King Orion. With its play on words in the title, "Exolotl" the game clearly draws inspiration from the real-life cute animal, the axolotl. The character designs embody the charming features of axolotls, adding a touch of whimsy and friendliness to the game.

The game's core mechanics center around platforming and action-oriented gameplay. Players control Zian, the sword wielding prince, and his friends as they navigate through levels, defeat enemies, and ultimately save the Planet.

Exolotl : Zian's touch control layout is a bit different that what mobile gamers are used to, as it features a traditional cross style on-screen button layout more commonly seen in physical controllers. The traditional button format allows console oriented players to have a more familiar looking layout.

The ability to switch between characters seamlessly during specific levels, without any resource requirement or cooldown, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging, encouraging players to experiment and discover whoâ€™s effective against different enemies and bosses. However, it would have been even more compelling if each character had a wholly unique gameplay mechanic or skill tree, further emphasizing their individuality.

Exolotl: Zian offers a good variety of levels and themes that take players on an adventure through different environments. From lush jungles, underwater realms, cyberpunk cities, each level presents its own set of challenges and opportunities for exploration. In some levels, you'll find yourself navigating flimsy platforms that can break if you stand on them for too long, while in one, you'll be sprinting away from a colossal tsunami, avoiding enemies and obstacles on the way to safety.

Exolotl: Zian strikes a balance between accessibility and challenge, catering to both casual and more experienced players. Although there are no difficulty levels, the levels are fairly challenging, and the health point system on top of multiple lives and checkpoints provide a forgiving element to the retro game style. The boss battles require skillful timing and learning the boss' attack patterns to overcome. However, overall, they are not at a hardcore difficulty level. My only gripe is that the bosses' hitboxes are sometimes hard to gauge, leading to unnecessary damage.
