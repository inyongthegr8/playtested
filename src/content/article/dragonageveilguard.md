**Dragon Age: Veilguard** has been at the center of intense discussion since its launch, with much of the controversy stemming from its art style and perceived emphasis on diversity. However, beneath the noise lies a substantial RPG experience that builds on the legacy of the franchise with bold gameplay and storytelling choices.

- üéôÔ∏è Engaging storytelling with notable narration by Varric  
- üîÑ Convenient fast travel system enhancing exploration flow

- üó∫Ô∏è Quest bloat with many filler quests that can feel repetitive  
- üêû Some reused maps for multiple quests reducing variety

From the outset, Veilguard adopts a more action-oriented combat system reminiscent of God of War, a notable departure from the tactical depth of earlier Dragon Age titles. This shift feels natural in the context of evolving RPG trends, and I found the combat both engaging and exhilarating, with fluid animations and satisfying impact. One gripe though, is that while there is still a party system, you cannot control other characters anymore and are now stuck to your chosen class. You cannot try other class except for when starting a new savefile and creating a different class. This is very different from the previous games where you could 'sample' other classes by way of playing the characters, such as Morrigan or Varric.

The quest design in Veilguard on the other hand is impressive. The game offers a mixture of open-world exploration and linear narrative progression, balancing verticality and clever use of space. Waypointing and quest tracking are clear, helpful and i would even say an raises the bar for how quest navigation should be done. This makes juggling multiple quests manageable, as you can track multiple quets and they can all appear in your compass/minimap so you won't miss a point of interest just because a quest wasn't actively selected. It's very easy to do questing here, even if the sheer volume can become overwhelming.

Yet, the abundance of side quests can also be a double-edged sword. Many filler tasks involve simple fetch or investigate objectives that feel repetitive and dilute the overall experience. This quest bloat is not unique to Veilguard, but it is notable enough to impact pacing, especially for players like me who tend to complete everything. Fast travel is implemented thoughtfully, allowing for quick movement without detracting from exploration. This convenience helps manage the sprawling map, making it easier to traverse between distant quest hubs and points of interest.

Visually, the initial shock of the new art style and character proportions was hard to ignore. The exaggerated "cartoon-like" facial features and body proportions were indeed jarring. However, as I progressed, I found the world-building, environmental detail, and animation quality more than made up for it, and the art style is quite nice anyway when you look at it objectively. The game‚Äôs artistic choices distinguishes it from the other Dragon Age games and create a unique identity within the series.

Character interactions and storytelling remain a highlight, as with previous games. Conversations and choices are still here, choices that can and will affect the story in a multitude of ways. People might die or survive, enemies might survive or not. The narration by Varric adds a familiar and enjoyable storytelling voice, bringing life and personality to questlines. Many of the main story moments generated genuine hype and unexpected goosebumps, particularly for longtime fans who have followed the series through its evolution and are waiting for the grand culmination. In fact, if you were that invested in the series starting from the first one up up Dragon Age: Inquisition, playing this one up to the very end is worth it, and it pays off. They pulled off a surprisingly satisfying ending in this one, guys.

While Veilguard does stumble on some fronts ‚Äî including the art style controversy and quest repetition ‚Äî it still delivers a compelling, immersive RPG experience with enough depth and charm to satisfy fans.

### Conclusion

Despite its controversies and some design missteps, **Dragon Age: Veilguard** delivers a robust and engaging RPG experience. Its action combat, well-crafted quests, and storytelling make it a worthwhile play, especially for fans of the series looking for a fresh take on the Dragon Age formula, while at the same time probably a bitter sweet goodbye and ending to the franchise, that is, until EA decides to go against the currents and do another one.
