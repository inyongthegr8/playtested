Burst Space is a retro-style Roguelite top down shooter that puts players into a pixelated sci-fi universe inhabited by a cast of endearing warrior waifu girls known as Einherjar, the game promises an engaging blend of accessible gameplay and strategic depth with its roguelite gameplay and progression system.


**Pros:**
- Experimentation and Customization
- Engaging progression
- Unique boss encounters
- Waifu Einherjar characters



**Cons:**
- Poor translation
- Server connection problems
- Performance issues
- Always online feature


Released on Android, currently only for the Philippines region, Burst Space introduces players to intense bullet-hell like battles, abilities experimentation, and the opportunity to collect and customize their waifu Einherjar warriors. The visual allure of Burst Space lies in its nostalgic and simple pixel art style, a fusion of retro charm and contemporary design. Resulting in a visually adequate and enjoyable experience that appeals to both pixel art enthusiasts and those new to the style.

The overarching objective is to rescue the Einherjar from each planet and harness their power to conquer bosses, unlock equipment, and further enhance the characters' skills and abilities. Burst Space also features free-to-play elements like battle passes, events, and premium Einherjar, offering players the option to personalize and extend their gameplay experience using the power of real money.

Burst Space's gameplay mechanics are balanced to provide accessibility without sacrificing strategic depth. The automatic aiming system simplifies combat by allowing players to focus on tactics rather than precise aiming — although there is still an option to toggle manual aiming for those who dare.

By holding down the fire button, the character automatically targets enemies, making battles smooth and engaging. This design choice ensures that even players unfamiliar with the roguelite genre can jump in and enjoy the action. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean Burst Space isn't a complex game. Players will still need to dodge, use skill abilities, and summon Einherjar companions to conquer the battlefield.

Additionally, the roguelite aspect brings a randomized element to the gameplay through bonus modifiers. These modifiers offer unique effects under specific conditions, encouraging players to adapt their tactics based on the modifiers encountered. This balance between accessibility and depth makes Burst Space an inviting experience for both newcomers and experienced players.

At its core, Burst Space thrives on experimentation and customization. While not as intricate as some of its roguelite counterparts, the game encourages players to explore various skills, abilities, and upgrades to optimize their approach.  Burst Space embraces player creativity by offering a multitude of choices, especially in longer levels where there are more choices, ensuring that the gameplay experience remains engaging and dynamic. The depth of gameplay isn't solely confined to individual runs though, as the character's true power level lies in the progression system outside of battles.

Level Progression in Burst Space is centered around the player's quest to rescue Einherjar across twelve planets. Each planet presents its own unique aesthetic and challenges, culminating in a challenging boss encounter. As players advance through the levels, they acquire equipment, weapons, and accessories, adding more Einherjar to the available roster. Skill customization and weapon mastery upgrades contribute to character growth, allowing for personalized play styles and strategies. Burst Space's progression system strikes a balance between depth and accessibility, providing a rewarding sense of advancement and mastery.

However, Burst Space is not without its drawbacks. The game is poorly translated to English, potentially detracting from the game's overall charm. Additionally, persistent server connection problems and stutters can disrupt even the simplest tasks as basic as upgrading something, or even just navigating the menu, impeding the flow of the game potentially causing frustration among players — considering the game is always online and not playable offline. In addition, even with the game's retro graphics, it still suffers from occasional performance issues even with a Snapdragon 888 device.

As with its free-to-play elements like battle passes, events, quests, and premium Einherjar, Burst Space offers players the opportunity to enhance and personalize their gaming experience. There is also an option to use ads to force additional rolls, for example in reroll the selection of ability bonuses during runs. While these elements can extend the longevity of the game, it's important to note that they come with the option to spend real money. This approach to monetization might not resonate with all players, potentially affecting their overall enjoyment of the game.

Conclusion:

Burst Space presents an intriguing journey through a pixelated universe, blending retro aesthetics with modern gameplay mechanics and roguelite features. The game's strategic bullet hell infused gameplay, combined with its engaging progression system and waifu Einherjar characters, ensures a would-be fun experience for a wide range of players. However, there are technical issues that heavily hamper the experience, along with its always-online requirements and F2P monetization elements that aren’t always a match for these roguelite games.
