Recently launched worldwide, Harry Potter: Magic Awakened is a free-to-play mobile game that offers fans an immersive mobile experience in the Wizarding World like never before, featuring a captivating story and a journey filled with magic, friendship, and intrigue.

Harry Potter: Magic Awakened features a brand new story that takes place shortly after the events of the original series, providing a rare but key glimpse into the aftermath of Harry Potter’s main story. As a newly accepted student, you'll unravel an intriguing narrative that builds upon the foundations laid by the Harry Potter books. The story beautifully blends familiar elements with new and engaging plotlines, ensuring that both die-hard fans and newcomers will be equally engaged.

Harry Potter: Magic Awakened also allows players to relive memorable moments from the original series, even going as far as having a bonus story mode dedicated to it. These flashbacks are narrated by various characters, adding depth and nostalgia to the overall storyline that existing fans will surely appreciate. The game's impressive use of fully animated and voice-acted cutscenes enhances the immersive narrative, offering a level of storytelling rarely seen in mobile games and is much closer to PC and console games.

bonus story mode dedicated to it.

Harry Potter: Magic Awakened weaves a compelling narrative that — unsurprisingly — revolves around the lives of a group of young witches and wizards, including the player-created main character, highly mirroring the premise of the original series but still managing to give a fresh experience.

As opposed to its AAA counterpart Hogwarts Legacy, the story of Magic Awakened is a much more grounded one, with the character not really being a chosen one or gifted type of character and just a regular student in Hogwarts.  The stakes are not overly high, and many of the quests focus on slice-of-life stories that immerse players in the daily life of a Hogwarts student. Year 1 up to Year 2 is entirely playable, Year 3 and 4 content yet to be released.

As the player-created main character, you join a diverse group of aspiring witches and wizards, including the headstrong and entitled Cassandra, the feisty Frey twins who prefer dueling to forming friendships, the mysterious but friendly Ivy Warrington, the daring Quidditch enthusiast Robyn, the intellectually curious Kevin, the introverted potion-making expert Daniel, and the artistic and observant Lottie. Each supporting character brings their unique personality, dreams, and challenges to the table, creating a dynamic group that grows and evolves together.

The developers have struck a fine balance between a traditional mobile game and a proper narrative-driven game. While the story takes center stage, players have the option to fast forward or skip cutscenes if they prefer to focus solely on the deck-building and combat gameplay.

The world-building in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened is nothing short of magical. From the bustling streets of Diagon Alley to the hallowed halls of Hogwarts, the game faithfully recreates the iconic locations we've come to love. While the stylized graphics may not rival those of higher-budget titles, the game captures the essence and atmosphere of the Harry Potter universe, transporting players to a world filled with wonder and adventure.
