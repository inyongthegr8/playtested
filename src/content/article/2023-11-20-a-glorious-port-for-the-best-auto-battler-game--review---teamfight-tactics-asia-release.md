üéÆGameplay

In Teamfight Tactics (TFT), players strategically assemble teams of champions, each with unique abilities and synergies, on a hexagonal board. The game consists of recruitment phases where champions are purchased, preparation phases for positioning and itemization, and auto-battle phases where teams engage in combat automatically depending on unit composition and placement. It's basically a round-based PvP auto-chess game with unique twists and engaging mechanics.

Players must build synergistic teams to maximize bonuses and counter opponents. The gold economy plays a crucial role, allowing players to reroll champions, level up, or buy experience points to gain more unit slots. The item system lets champions equip and upgrade items for enhanced power. Carousel rounds add strategic choices, and health points decrease with each round loss.  The thrill of watching your carefully crafted team clash with opponents is always an exciting feeling that engages players inner competitiveness without much reliance on fast reflexes or split-second decision making, unlike games like League of Leagues or Valorant.

The game features ranked modes, regular updates, and a dynamic meta, making TFT a compelling and strategic auto-battler experience where adaptability and decision-making are paramount.

üåêCrossplay Capabilities

Fans of TFT on PC, as well as mobile gamers across APAC, will now be able to play TFT on their Android and Apple devices with full crossplay and cross-progression support with PC. However, it's not designed for seamless switching, so you'll probably need to hold off on your hopes of starting a match on PC and then continuing it on your phone in your living room as you go out.

üé®Graphics and Art Style

TFT Mobile maintains the visually pleasing aesthetic of the League of Legends universe, with vibrant and detailed champion designs. The transition to mobile devices doesn't compromise the visual quality; the graphics are crisp, and the art style remains consistent with the PC version. The intuitive user interface ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience, even on smaller screens.

üíµMonetization

TFT Mobile adopts a free-to-play model with in-app purchases. The monetization strategy primarily focuses on cosmetic items, such as new champion skins and Little Legends, which have no impact on gameplay. This is probably my most favorite form of monetization, one that balances player satisfaction and financial success. Still free-to-play, but no pay-to-win mechanisms.

üìäTechnical Performance

TFT Mobile is a great port, and players won't face significant disadvantages compared to their PC counterparts, especially on tablets. The only potential concern is the screen size, which will vary among users.  I tested the game on an iPhone 13 Mini and I did not experience any performance issues. Even with such a tiny screen, the game remains playable, although I would recommend playing it on a bigger screen, since there is no way to increase the UI scale if you find it too small. Battery drain and heat aren‚Äôt issues in my experience, in fact, it‚Äôs just like browsing Facebook or watching YouTube.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

The quality of TFT Mobile both as a port and as an autobattler game deserves commendation. Riot Games has masterfully translated the intricate and strategic gameplay of the PC version into a mobile format without compromising its essence. Now, players in Asia can enjoy the same level of depth and excitement on their Android and Apple devices, making TFT Mobile a stellar example of a successful mobile port.
