The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is a captivating story-driven game that presents players with an immersive narrative experience that revolves around Fortuna, a fortune-teller Witch banished to exile on an asteroid. Developed by the creators of The Red Strings Club and feeling like a spiritual successor, The game's premise is rooted in crafting a personalized Tarot deck, reclaiming freedom, and influencing the destiny of the cosmic Witch society.


**Pros:**


+Intriguing Narrative that carries the whole game
+Personalize your own Tarot Deck of cards, including the artwork
+Well written story and characters
+Choices do matter


**Cons:**


-Zero voice acting, players must read everything in this narrative driven game
-Slow pacing, especially the first few minutes
-For mature audiences only

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood allows players to assume the role of Fortuna, a Witch exiled for a thousand years who forms a forbidden pact with a godlike otherworldly creature to regain her freedom. Players will assume control of Fortuna 200 years into her exile, what will happen is up to the players, reconnect with fellow Witches, forge new relationships, and utilize the Tarot cards you've customized to unveil their pasts and futures. The narrative spans generations, inviting players to contemplate the intricate themes of identity, community, and individual responsibility within the beautifully handcrafted world, providing a thought-provoking depth that resonates with players.

The game features a retro art style and visual presentation common in indie games. The pixel art creates a mesmerizing and distinct atmosphere that I would like to compare to the recent game that I’ve played, Coffee Talk. The lack of voice acting is compensated by the soundtrack that spans over three hours, offering a range of melodies that complement the game's themes and emotions. The absence of voice acting in favor of silent interactions contributes to the slice of life ambiance, adding a unique touch to the storytelling. This approach aligns with the retro low-fi visual vibe, merging seamlessly with the narrative and gameplay.

The plot is rightfully intriguing; even without voice acting, it compelled me to play. However, it can get a bit boring honestly, especially in the first few minutes --- with lots of dialogue to read against a static pixel art background with nothing else for the players to do. ---- this is before everything related to Tarot Deck customization and deck building clicks in, which made the game actually compelling to play.

While gameplay takes a backseat to the narrative, it isn't entirely overlooked. The customization and crafting system of the Tarot deck provides an engaging mechanic that goes beyond aesthetics. You can tailor your deck by selecting from a variety of backgrounds, characters, and symbols, each with its own meaning when fused together. Furthermore, you have the opportunity to design the artwork of each card individually, gradually building your deck over time. The currency to craft these cards takes the form of the elemental energies; Air, Water, Earth, and Fire, which are then replenished by performing readings with characters, enabling you to craft additional cards for your deck.

Although the card artwork editor doesn't drastically alter the gameplay, it injects a flavor of personality into the experience, which is actually quite cool and serves as the one of main draws, as this personal customization provides a sense of personal investment and a core personality to the gameplay.

Additionally, the choices you make genuinely matter, shaping the course of the story and the fate of the Witch society. This balance between narrative-driven and gameplay-driven elements creates an experience that caters to players seeking both engagement and emotional resonance.

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood's plot shines with its well-written narrative and multi-dimensional characters. Despite the fantastical elements like witches and godly beings, the characters are portrayed in a relatable and authentic manner, each harboring their own distinct relationships and complexities. In total, it can take players up to ten hours to finish one playthrough.

Each Witch, old or new, carries their own baggage and relationships, contributing to the complex web of interests that surround the coven and beyond. This depth transforms the characters — well, most of them — from mere game elements into individuals you care about, driving your desire to influence their destinies. Despite having a good story, it's not for everyone, it catered for more mature audiences especially for sexual and gender sensitive overtones, but if you’re fine with those, then by all means.

Conclusion:

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is not a game for everyone, especially considering its mature themes and slower start. However, if you're open to a unique blend of storytelling, personalization, and thought-provoking themes, this game offers would-be players to shape the destinies of its enchanting universe—a journey well worth taking for those seeking a bewitching narrative adventure that's anything but ordinary.
