Black Book RPG is a witchcraft-themed adventure role-playing game that puts players in a dark and mystical world inspired by Russian folklore. Developed by Morteshka and published by HypeTrain Digital, the game features an intruiging story, a beautiful art style, and adventure RPG mechanics.

The game follows the story of Vasilisa, a young sorceress who embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Black Book — an ancient tome of immense power — to revive a loved one. Set in a fictional version of 19th century Russia, the game combines elements of mythology, history, and folklore to create a rich magical world that players will find captivating and engrossing.

Black Book features a card-based combat system. Or rather, "page-based". As wielder of the Black Book, Vasilisa collects magically ever changing pages and comes up with her own line-up to battle demons.Players collect these pages which represent spells and abilities and use them strategically in battles against supernatural creatures.

In addition to combat, the game also features role-play decision making, puzzles, and exploration elements. Players must solve puzzles to progress through the story, and they can choose to visit certain locations in the mini-map, deviate from the main quest, and explore the world to find additional items and secrets.

In some locations, a player will be presented with different choices, some having a good, neutral, or bad effect. Such as losing health, or gaining an item. The game overall strikes a good balance between combat, role-playing, puzzles, and exploration, ensuring that players always have something interesting to do.

The game's art style is also worth mentioning. The hand-drawn looking characters are beautiful and detailed, with a dark and moody atmosphere that perfectly captures the game's supernatural themes. The art style is switching back and forth between Another World-esque paint-like visuals for the 3D world, with more traditional 2D cartoonish visuals for the character dialogues. The game also features a fitting soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere and helps to create a sense of foreboding and uneasiness.

However, Black Book can be slow at times, with long periods of explanation and dialogue inserted between combat and exploration sequences. The narrative can only do so much to keep players interested, and even with the various choices that you can make, it may not be enough for some. Also, the combat isn’t as flashy as anime-inspired games with turn-based combat, so players might find the presentation underwhelming.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
