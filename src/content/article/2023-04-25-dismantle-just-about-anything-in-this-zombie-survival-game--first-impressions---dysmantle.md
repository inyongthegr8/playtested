Dysmantle takes place on a shelter island after a zombie apocalypse has wiped out most of humanity. You play as a survivor who wants to escape the island, as such, he must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, and fight off dangerous creatures to stay alive and escape in this open-world island.

While the game was originally released back in 2021, a new DLC titled “Doomsday” has just come out on PC featuring an all-new questline, open world map, and tools to use. It’s not yet available for the mobile platform — the version that I am playing — but is currently set to release later this year.

One of the most notable features of Dysmantle is its crafting system, or rather, the “Dismantling” system; Almost every object in the game world; furniture, appliances, barricades, doors, etc. can be dismantled by the crowbar into its component parts like wood and metal, which can then be used to invent and craft new items. Every object you dismantle in the game will give resources and experience.

The island is huge and there are countless areas to explore. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter new areas, enemies, and obstacles that will require you to level up and explore even further to be properly equipped to survive. This makes the game incredibly engaging and gives players a sense of discovery and exploration.

The combat in Dysmantle is just a simple top-down system. Move your character around, and swing or fire your weapon on the target locked enemy. You can also dodge to quickly avoid enemies. You can craft a variety of weapons, such as knives, bats, and guns, to help you fight off enemies. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses. Dying is very forgiving — you just drop your current loot and respawn to the last campfire you visited — with the option to recover your loot if you visit your corpse where you died.

The enemies themselves are challenging but ultimately can be cheesed with a repeatable strategy to defeat. Overall, the combat is passable, but the touchscreen controls have made it slightly harder than using physical controllers.

In summary, Dysmantle offers a fresh take on the zombie survival genre with its top-down view and unique crafting mechanics, which set it apart from the first-person and third-person zombie games that dominate the market. At just $10 for a one-time purchase and with a new DLC set to release this year, it's definitely worth a try for any survival crafting fans looking for a fresh new experience.
