In the not-so-distant future of 2177, humanity faces an existential threat in the form of a cataclysmic event. It's in this dystopian setting that Cyber Rebellion takes center stage,  a mobile game poised for a soft launch on October 25, 2023, offering players a glimpse into a world on the brink of destruction, where advanced machines and robots have turned against their creators.

Cyber Rebellion introduces players to an engaging turn-based gameplay experience. Players can assemble a team of up to six characters, each with unique skills and abilities. While you don't control regular attacks, the game introduces a Tactical Points system that accumulates with normal attacks. These points can be strategically used to unleash powerful special attacks, not only adding strength to your arsenal but also providing visually captivating combat sequences.

The game offers a range of challenging combat modes, from the story mode and challenges, to epic battles with world bosses, ensuring that there's always a thrilling challenge to overcome. Cyber Rebellion offers a deep character upgrade system, allowing players to customize the transformation strategy of each warrior. I can even evolve my characters into other higher variants, and keep the same level, which is nice as I don't always have to pull new characters and re-level in order to increase my team power.

I am already smelling a grind/pay wall in my first few hours of play, even still, the mechanics of how upgrades are done can be addicting enough on its own right, combine that with the stunning and eye candy visuals and this is game that can be a mainstay for you for a daily farming basis.
