‚ú®Overview

RoboCop: Rogue City is one of the most surprising game releases this year (and one of the most unexpected announcements from as far back as 2021). Just when you might have thought that RoboCop isn't the pop culture icon it once was, it has returned from dormancy and come back to life. Developing a video game adaptation of an action movie from 1987 isn't typically a top priority for most developers and publishers these days. However, Teyon and Nacon aren't your typical companies. Fortunately, they understandably want to capitalize on the coolness of '80s action movies, having previously delivered the mildly excellent Terminator: Resistance in 2019. And now, we have RoboCop: Rogue City.

Developed by Teyon and published by Nacon, RoboCop: Rogue City brings the iconic RoboCop with a blend of nostalgia and modern gaming elements. As a fan of the 1987 action film and someone with a penchant for action-packed shooters, I found myself excited to dive into this title, which promised to capture the essence of the late 1980s while leveraging Unreal Engine 5's graphical prowess.


**Pros:**


+Fun and gratifying combat
+Destructible environments
+Captures the tone of the original RoboCop film
+Progression system that keeps the gameplay fresh


**Cons:**


-Weak story, pacing, and side content
-Dated graphics and AI

‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 7/10

üìñStory and Premise

Set between the events of "RoboCop 2" and "RoboCop 3," it explores the story of the titular cyborg, Alex Murphy, as he confronts a new wave of criminal activity in Detroit. The game's premise is intriguing, it offers an extended take on the RoboCop universe, but its nothing special or groundbreaking.

A mysterious figure known as "The New Guy" rallies Detroit's top gangs, creating chaos in the city. The police force, under the control of Omni Consumer Products (OCP), is struggling to maintain order, leading to a complex web of challenges for RoboCop. As a player, you'll navigate through various story threads, including aiding a snooping journalist, attending therapy sessions, and partnering with a new recruit who is also an OCP informant. The story isn‚Äôt the game‚Äôs strongest suit, and is mostly an excuse for Alex to mow down foe after foe.

RoboCop: Rogue City excels in capturing the essence of the original RoboCop film, preserving its satirical and darkly humorous tone. The character models, animations, and dialogue contribute to this satirical atmosphere, reminding players of the film's signature blend of social commentary and campy action.

üé®Graphics and Art Style

The game's graphics, powered by Unreal Engine 5, offer a mix of high fidelity and dated visuals. While the character models and textures appear somewhat outdated, it's clear that the developers aimed to enhance them with modern technology. Unfortunately, this approach results in a feeling that the game's assets were ported from the PS3 era into Unreal Engine 5. In essence, it feels like an HD remaster of a non-existent PS3-era game. The developer‚Äôs previous game: Terminator: Resistance, look just about the same in terms of graphical fidelity.

However, despite these graphical limitations, "RoboCop: Rogue City" effectively recreates the gritty and glossy plastic look of the original film. Environments maintain the grime and style of the late 80s.

üéÆGameplay and Combat

RoboCop: Rogue City succeeds in reviving the nostalgia of 80s action movies while introducing some modern gaming mechanics. The game offers a narrative-driven first-person shooter experience with some emphasis on storytelling, character development, and intense combat.

The core experience of playing as RoboCop is exhilarating, and the game's action sequences are undeniably fun. Charging headlong into battle, guns blazing and foes falling, makes you feel like an unstoppable killing machine, a true RoboCop.

The combat system is simple, yet satisfying. Playing on normal difficulty, I didn't need to worry much about taking cover or dodging bullets, as RoboCop is built to withstand a hail of gunfire. Mowing down adversaries with sheer firepower is incredibly gratifying. While the AI of your foes leaves something to be desired, their often comical interactions provide some amusement.

The destructible environment adds an extra layer of enjoyment. It propels the feeling of being an unstoppable force, capable of tearing through anything in your path. Blasting through walls, creating chaos in the environment, and watching the world crumble around you is pure exhilaration.

While RoboCop's signature sidearm, with unlimited ammo, is a reliable tool, the game offers a variety of firearms. Automatic weapons provide a satisfying kick, but shotguns and sniper rifles are less compelling. However, enemy AI falls short in terms of intelligence, often standing in place, struggling with cover, or, occasionally, even harming each other in the chaos.

All in all, the combat in RoboCop: Rogue City is like a power fantasy come to life. RoboCop is a formidable figure who can absorb bullets and march through enemy fire with confidence. Taking out adversaries is a blast, and there's a certain joy in popping off headshots while strolling through a hail of bullets. The game manages to balance RoboCop's power by introducing tougher challenges in the form of larger enemy numbers and stronger weaponry during boss battles.

‚è´Progression

While RoboCop: Rogue City remembers what made games fun with all the power fantasy of being Robocop it gives you, it does not double down on it and instead opted to modernize the gameplay with RPG-like mechanics. It incorporates a progression system that enhances the gameplay experience. As you level up, you unlock new skill perks and upgrades that provide new abilities and tools to deal with enemies. This gradual growth keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, offering a sense of advancement as you play.

The skill points can be allocated to various traits, such as Combat, Armor, Engineering, and Deduction. These traits offer unique perks that add depth to combat and exploration. For example, you can increase your mobility, or perhaps you‚Äôd prefer more survivability. These skill choices provide players with the opportunity to tailor their playstyle and approach to the game.

There is also some decision-driven dialogue that presents opportunities to shape RoboCop's character. Players can choose to adhere strictly to the law or adopt a more friendly approach. The decisions you make influence the story's direction and can lead to multiple endings, providing a minor sense of freedom in the game's narrative.

The game is at its best when you are shooting people in missions. However, in between them, during the rather boring police station scenes and dialogue segments, the game still has a certain charm and comical moments that serve as a short reprieve from the relentless action, although I wouldn't miss them if they weren't in the game.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

RoboCop: Rogue City is a welcome return of the iconic RoboCop character. While the game is not without its flaws, such as AI issues, dated graphics, and occasional pacing problems, it successfully captures the spirit of the original films. It delivers an entertaining and brutal first-person shooter experience, full of thrilling references and enjoyably cheesy and campy humor.
