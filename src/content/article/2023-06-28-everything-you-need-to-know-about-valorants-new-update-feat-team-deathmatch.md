VALORANT Mobile
9.1
Multiplayer
Fast-paced
Pre-register

Valorant’s patch 7.0 has finally gone online and it introduces the highly requested Team Deathmatch mode along with a new Agent Deadlock , and three exclusive maps made specifically for the new game mode: Piazza, District, and Kasbah. In terms of aesthetics, Piazza bears a resemblance to Ascent with its European architecture, District resembles Split with its urban Japanese setting, and Kasbah shares similarities with Bind with its African location.

Valorant's new Team Deathmatch mode is an exciting addition that offers players a fast-paced and action-packed experience. Unlike the standard free-for-all Deathmatch where players compete to reach 40 kills or achieve the most kills within a 9-minute timeframe, Team Deathmatch divides players into two teams, each consisting of five players, competing against each other in a race to reach 100 kills or have the highest kill count within a match duration of 9 minutes and 30 seconds.

The release of the new Sentinel Agent, Deadlock, brings fresh gameplay options. Deadlock is equipped with nanowires that help secure the battlefield. The abilities of Deadlock include Sonic Sensors, which detect footsteps and sounds, concussing enemies upon detection. The Barrier Mesh ability deploys a shield that blocks movement but not bullets, allowing for strategic positioning. The Gravnet ability is a grenade that forces enemies caught in its area of effect to crouch and move slowly.

Deadlock's ultimate ability, Annihilation, functions similarly to Sova's ultimate. It unleashes a beam of nanowires that captures the first enemy caught and slowly pulls them along a path, eventually causing them to die unless they are rescued by their teammates.

The mode features four stages within the match, with each stage having its own loadout and upgraded lethality. At the beginning of each stage, players have the opportunity to choose their loadout in the Spawn Room or anytime they respawn. This allows players to tailor their weapon selection according to their playstyle and preferences. It's worth noting that there is no in-game economy in Team Deathmatch, so players are not required to manage their economy or purchase weapons during the match.

To enhance the gameplay experience, Weapon Spawners are strategically placed throughout the map in fixed locations. These Spawners offer different weapons (especially shotguns and snipers which are not available in the stages) that players can acquire. It's important for teams to quickly reach and secure these weapons to gain an advantage over the opposing team. The weapons available from the Spawners may vary from match to match, and they improve as the match progresses through the stages.

Additionally, there are Recovery and Ultimate Orbs scattered around the map. When players collect a Recovery Orb, it grants a buff that gradually restores their Health and Shield over a duration of 6 seconds. These Recovery Orbs are available in specific sections of each map, and both teams will compete to claim them. Ultimate Orbs, on the other hand, contribute to charging up players' Ultimate abilities. Collecting Ultimate Orbs increases the players' Ultimate percentage, bringing them closer to activating their powerful ultimates.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, abilities in Team Deathmatch will recharge over time after being used. However, different abilities have varying recharge times, so players must strategically manage their ability usage. Upon death, players respawn in their team's Spawn Room, which provides a brief period of invulnerability for 15 seconds. After this initial protection, players will begin taking damage if they remain in the Spawn Room, encouraging them to swiftly return to the battlefield.

The match concludes when a team reaches 100 kills or has the highest kill count at the end of the 9 minutes and 30 seconds duration. If a match ends before either team reaches 100 kills, the team with the highest kill count emerges as the victor. In the event of a tied score at the end of the match, it results in a draw.

The new Team Deathmatch mode offers a dynamic and thrilling experience, catering to both casual players and competitive enthusiasts. With its fast-paced gameplay, stage-based loadouts, weapon spawners, orbs, and intense gunplay, it provides a refreshing alternative to the traditional modes in Valorant.
