I tried out Flash Party recently, coinciding with the recent update Season 9 and I got to say, after going in blind in playing it, the graphics and gameplay actually wowed me. I am using an old 2018 flagship android phone to play it and the visuals still look crisp and nice with console levels of quality that even looks better than the Switch’s own Super Smash Bros.

The gameplay is very similar to Super Smash Bros. In Flash Party, players get matched up with other players in either 1v1, 2v2, or free for all 4 player matches (either ranked or unranked), and the whole goal of the game is to knock the opposition out of the arena and to deplete their stars by pushing them off the edge of the arena by using various types of attacks. For newcomers like me, Flash Party is pretty straightforward to learn, with an interactive tutorial that can introduce you to the basics in just a few minutes and get you ready for matches in no time.

Players get two kinds of attacks, regular and skill attacks. Each can be performed in four different directions. The touch control scheme is nicely implemented, allowing for swipe gestures with the attack buttons instead of purely relying on movement directions. The jumping is a little bit harder to control, because of the fear of falling, but it doesn’t take long to get used to it.

The combat is a lot of fun, and the mechanic of having to push your enemies off the ledges and edges make for a frantic gameplay action that is a nice change of scenery from the usual health bar mechanic that other fighting games have. The option to team up in 4 player matches also adds a lot to the mayhem and fun factor and allows players to team up with a friend.

Flash Party features a roster of more than 20 characters each with their different move sets, abilities, and cosmetics that you can unlock and purchase. Most of the characters themselves are locked at the start and players can unlock some of them via playing the game or by purchasing some from the hero shop.

As part of being a free-to-play live-service offering, Flash Party also frequently releases updates that equate into different Seasons, with the most recent one being Season 9 titled “Wheel of Destiny”. Season 9 adds new sets of skins, a new Dojo system feature (the much awaited clan-like system), along with a new Party Pass for players to conquer.

So far, Flash Party has been one of my favorites of all the recent mobile games that I’ve tried. Its fun combat, easy controls, and pleasing visuals make it a stand out among other fighting games. This is a game that I can see myself regularly playing, especially on the go.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
