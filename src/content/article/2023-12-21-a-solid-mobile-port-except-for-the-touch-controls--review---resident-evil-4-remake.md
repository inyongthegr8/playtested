‚ú®Overview

The 2023 GOTY contender Resident Evil 4 has finally made its mark on Apple devices, bringing the recent and already iconic survival horror experience to mobile phones, tablets, and Mac. Capcom's decision to release this remake on Apple devices is a significant milestone for mobile gaming, especially considering the game's recent release this year for current-gen consoles and PC. This is probably the first time we are getting a 1:1 mobile port of a technically and visually impressive AAA game, in the same year.

As one of the early AAA game releases for Apple devices, Resident Evil 4 adopts a free-to-download demo model, with the full game accessible through an in-app purchase. The base price of $60 might be a bit high for arguably the worst platform you can play it on, but a 50% launch discount to 30$ sounds very enticing.


**Pros:**
- Same 1:1 gameplay experience, as its PC/Console counterparts
- Well balanced survival horror and action elements
- Fluid and satisfying combat
- Compelling story and progression



**Cons:**
- Touch control implementation is borderline unplayable. A controller is highly recommended
- Resolution and textures are not very sharp looking


‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 7/10

üìñStory and Premise

Resident Evil 4 continues the story of Leon S. Kennedy, picking up a few years later where Resident Evil 2 left off. Leon is on a new mission to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the US president. The remake introduces additional story elements and scenes, expanding on the original game and incorporating flashbacks from Resident Evil 2's remake. The tone of the story has shifted to a more serious and realistic one, eschewing the cheesy one-liners and presenting a more vulnerable Leon. While characters remain consistent with their original versions, some charm has been toned down for the sake of realism.

üé®Graphics and Art Style

Granted, this iOS/iPadOS port has undergone some noticeable visual downgrades compared to its PC and console counterparts, but it remains impressive considering they are current-gen games that released earlier in the year, now running on an iPhone. In general, the visual quality is still a significant leap from the original 2005 game, featuring realistic environments, lifelike lighting, and stunning character details. The dark medieval setting and meticulous attention to detail contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. Character models and animations are well-crafted, and the realistic hair effects add to the overall visual appeal

üéÆGameplay

Resident Evil 4 Remake on mobile is the exact same game as its PC and console counterparts: a third-person shooter offering weighty movement and shooting mechanics that make players feel every action Leon takes. The game balances action-packed shooter gameplay with a terrifying horror experience. The linear, chapter-based adventure takes players through creepy cult-like settlements, providing a mix of enemy encounters and challenging puzzles. Boss fights with unique mechanics punctuate the journey, creating a well-rounded gameplay experience.

The remake in general introduces quality-of-life improvements, allowing Leon to engage in melee combat and counter enemy attacks. Optional challenges, mini-games, and bounties enhance exploration and offer additional content. The gameplay is more fluid and convenient than the original classic, providing players with freedom while preserving the core Resident Evil 4 experience.

I have no qualms about the game itself: it‚Äôs truly a wonderful reimagining of a masterpiece and a masterpiece in itself, with stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and an excellent narrative. I even rated it 5 out of 5 stars in my original review here https://www.taptap.io/post/4925421. Most of my gripes come from the approach taken in the mobile version and its few shortcomings.

üì±Mobile controls (Touch and Physical Controllers)

The touch controls are once again done in a similar approach to the implementation in Resident Evil Village. They just slapped a virtual on-screen gamepad on it and called it a day. It lacks full functionality and features you‚Äôd usually see in a native mobile game, making the touch-based experience clunky and challenging.

Movement and aiming feel cumbersome on touch, especially when moving, aiming, and firing simultaneously with the on-screen joysticks, LT and RT. Even navigating the menus feels very counter-intuitive. The virtual joystick overlay, while customizable, falls short of providing an optimal touch control experience.

Physical controllers, such as PlayStation or Xbox gamepads, are highly recommended for a superior gameplay experience, and perhaps the ONLY way to enjoy this title. This makes the game immediately more playable and comparable to let‚Äôs say playing it on a Steam Deck or a portable PS4.

üìäTechnical Performance

I played the game on an iPad Pro M1 model which targets a 1600x1118 resolution at 30FPS, but the game is also available for the iPhone 15 Pro which targets a 1560x720 resolution at 30FPS. For simplification purposes, let‚Äôs just say M1 devices target around under 1080p while the new iPhones target a little over 720p. Performance is a little bit better here now in my experience compared to RE: Village, and for a 30FPS portable experience, it‚Äôs even a job well done.

The visuals is also less than optimal in my eyes, with lots of aliasing (jagged edges). The graphics is a bit grainy looking and sometimes results into awkward looking visual artifacts especially during cutscenes, and it's definitely noticeable here especially if you have experienced this title in more powerful hardware such as on the PC or PS5.

In terms of settings, the game on iPad and iPhone does not support the adjustment of resolution or frame rate settings. This is noticeable different from Resident Evil Village‚Äôs approach where you can tweak all aspects of the graphics, which, in my opinion, is better here as having an optimized setting is probably the ideal way to experience the game, rather than attempting to maximize every aspect. Nevertheless, having the option to tweak some settings through an advanced option, instead of outright locking them, would have been a more nicer.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Resident Evil 4 is still that remarkable 2023 remake, just now on iPhone/iPad/Mac. Showcasing great attention to detail, visual fidelity, and gameplay improvements that position it among the best remakes to date. The game skillfully balances action and horror, providing a fresh experience even for those familiar with the original. Despite some minor drawbacks in this portable release, such as the subpar touch controls, noticeable visual downgrades, and limited 30FPS performance, Resident Evil 4 easily squeezes itself to my top 10 mobile games for this year and deserves your attention. Just ensure you have a controller to play this with and don‚Äôt even bother with the touch controls.
