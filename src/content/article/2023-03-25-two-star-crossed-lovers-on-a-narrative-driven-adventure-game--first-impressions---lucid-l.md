Lucid Lenses’ story is deep rooted in astronomy and the study of the cosmos. It features two star-crossed lives turned lovers living seemingly normal lives in somewhat unique circumstances; the man, Reymond, seems to be a smart astrophysicist locked in prison, and the woman, Emily, a university student studying astronomy, is accompanied by her blue bird that she can communicate with.

The gameplay I encountered is composed of point-and-click mechanics and puzzle elements that most of the time, incorporates themes of astrophysics; from the matching star constellations and mapping out planetary orbits, to the rhythm game element with a starry night backdrop.

It also features more mundane tasks like turning off alarm clocks or opening a letter to emphasize the slice of life storytelling format. And it works, accompanied by a moving melodramatic soundtrack, the narrative is relatable, immersive, and captivating.

Lucid Lenses’ plot is simple yet imaginative and unfolds beautifully throughout the five chapters. The alternating scenarios for the two characters and the narrative format is just amazingly delivered. It is very short, but very exciting because of the unpredictability of the story with regards to its chronological order and narrative turns.

The interactable gameplay and storytelling elements go well together and are nicely balanced, and it never really felt like a chore to play through. The puzzles are mildly challenging and the narrative is told in small chunks at a time.

At the outset, Lucid Lenses is a short but beautiful experience for a very affordable price. If you like astronomy, romance, or classic adventure games, I highly recommend trying it out.
