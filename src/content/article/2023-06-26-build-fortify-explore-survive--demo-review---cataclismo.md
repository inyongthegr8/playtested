Cataclismo

Cataclismo is a town building and tower defense real-time pausable strategy game where you build and defend the towers and walls of humanity that are struggling to survive in a fantasy world plagued by a hazardous mist and eerie creatures.

The graphics feature Another World-esque paint-like cel-shaded visuals for the 3D world, with a cleaner 2D art style for the character portraits and cinematics. It’s not that pleasing to the eyes and is supposed to add to the game’s bleak atmosphere. Additionally, the game also features a fitting hauntingly depressing soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere and helps to create a sense of the cataclysmic world.

Over the years, humanity has developed resilience against the mutating and lurking pale monsters within the mysterious mist that envelops the last remaining human city. However, these monsters have grown stronger, posing an even greater threat. In this strategy game, players will take on the role of leading the defense of the last human city. Recognizing that mere defense is insufficient, they will also embark on an expedition into the ruins of a forgotten kingdom, with the ultimate goal of reclaiming our world and constructing fortresses to ensure protection.

I played the demo, which consisted of the first two missions of the game. The first level, while slowly and methodically introducing the game mechanics, is a huge misstep in providing a proper first impression. Instead of diving straight into the base-building tower defense that the game heavily focuses on, it unnecessarily showcased a point-and-click style of adventure and exploration. On the other hand, the second mission serves as the true start of the actual gameplay. Players are tasked with rebuilding their fortress from its dilapidated state, gradually constructing it stone by stone, wall by wall, and structure by structure. Although the tutorials appear frequently and can be intrusive, they are informative and easily dismissed.

Cataclismo incorporates traditional base-building elements that will feel familiar to strategy fans. Elements like constructing sawmills or quarries to gather resources from the environment, building housing to accommodate the growing population, and establishing barracks to train and recruit troops. Players will also need to manage the quality of the air by constructing filters, adding another survival element.

These addictive and staple elements are seamlessly combined with frantic defense building and tower defense actions where you build walls, defense, and traps with a clever lego-style system that is equally as engaging as the town building aspect. If I was to compare it to another game, I would say They are Billions is the closest example I could think of in how the game combines both colony survival and tower defense wave survival gameplay.

Every night, waves of pale creatures present a challenge, testing the capability of your defenses. Even during the day, small groups of these monsters can stumble upon your castle as well. To protect your walls, you must strategically deploy militia units, traps, and various contraptions around your castle. Even if you manage to survive each night, the Mist remains, and the monsters will inevitably return the following night. To prepare for these endless threats, is it crucial to manage your resources, optimize your defenses, research your technologies, and venture beyond your territory, slowly claiming the land one small bit at a time while stumbling upon valuable deposits.

The game features a diverse range of units, each offering unique bonuses based on elevation and distance, encouraging strategic placement of units at different heights and distances. The Lego-style system is enjoyable to work with and gives the feeling of playing a sandbox game where you have the freedom to modularly construct walls and structures. However, it is limiting that it only allows for building at two angles, lacking the ability for diagonal placement or free rotation of structures. Additionally, some quality-of-life features are missing, such as the ease of recycling, repairing, or modifying existing units, and additional camera control options would have been welcomed.

Since the demo only included one level of base-building and tower defense action, I couldn't delve deeply into the game's progression, advanced technologies, and units. However, based on my experience, I can confidently say that the gameplay loop is addicting enough on its own, and there is great potential if the developers can create a rewarding progression system that keeps the game fresh throughout the levels. Besides the campaign, the game is also set to include Skirmish and Creative game modes, which are much-needed additions for a game that possesses sandbox-like qualities.

Conclusion:

Cataclismo is a game teeming with potential, offering a unique blend of colony survival, tower defense, and strategy elements. The combination of base-building, resource management, and defending against waves of enemies can offer an engaging and addictive gameplay experience for strategy game enthusiasts when it releases. For now, a free demo is out now as part of Steam’s Next Fest event.
