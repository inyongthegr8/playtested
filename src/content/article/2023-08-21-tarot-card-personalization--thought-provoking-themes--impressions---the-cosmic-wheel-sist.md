The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood allows players to assume the role of Fortuna, a Witch exiled for a thousand years who forms a forbidden pact with a godlike otherworldly creature to regain her freedom. Players will assume control of Fortuna 200 years into her exile, what will happen is up to the players, reconnect with fellow Witches, forge new relationships, and utilize the Tarot cards you've customized to unveil their pasts and futures.

Honestly, I thought the game was boring initially. First of all, there is no voice acting, which I value a lot when a game is narratively driven, there is lots of dialogue to read against a static pixel art background with nothing else for the players to do. However, the plot got more intriguing as I powered through the first few parts of the game, and then I was introduced to the actually cool Tarot Deck customization where the deck of cards I will use to read other characters is personally customized by the players. From the backgrounds to the characters to the symbols, up to the actual artwork you will see. The last part (artwork) is just for aesthetics purposes, but the rest have implications for the story, and the choices that you will make, that will matter.

So far, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood presents a decent narrative experience. The gameplay, while taking a backseat to the story, remains engaging and manages to hold its own with its unique Tarot Deck personalization. The game's strengths predominantly lie in its storytelling prowess, weaving an intriguing and thought-provoking plot that captures players' attention, although I find that it's not suited for everyone, because of deeply mature and gender sensitive overtones.
