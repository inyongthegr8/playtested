title: Don't sleep on this Batman Arkham game | Batman Arkham Origins Review
game: Batman Arkham Origins
---

**Batman Arkham Origins** serves as a worthy prequel to the acclaimed Arkham series, exploring Batman’s early years as a vigilante in Gotham. While it refines many elements of the series’ formula and offers a darker, grittier narrative, it struggles to reach the polish and impact of its predecessors.

## Pros
- 🌃 More open and detailed Gotham city to explore  
- 🦸 Familiar, fluid combat with refinements  
- 🎯 Intriguing story focusing on younger Batman’s struggles  
- 🔓 Improved mission variety and side content  
- 🎨 Strong voice acting and atmospheric audio  

## Cons
- 🐢 Progression system feels more restrictive and less rewarding  
- 🏙️ Some missions feel repetitive and padded  
- ⚙️ Technical glitches and bugs occasionally break immersion  

---

This prequel attempts to capture the raw beginnings of Batman’s crusade against crime, highlighting a less experienced but determined Dark Knight. The story takes a more grounded and somber tone, exploring Batman’s complex relationships with Gotham’s police force and rising criminals.

Gotham City feels larger and more detailed than in earlier titles, with a bustling atmosphere and more verticality in exploration. You can fast travel freely between the Batcave and the city, adding convenience to your patrols.

Combat remains tight and satisfying, closely following the successful freeflow system. The refinements make fights feel smoother, especially with new gadgets and counter moves. However, the progression system is a step back, locking upgrades behind unrelated challenges or missions rather than straightforward skill points, which can feel frustrating.

The game features several interesting side quests and activities, though some can feel repetitive and padded, diminishing the overall pace. The infamous Riddler trophies return, but like in Arkham City, they can become a tedious distraction.

Graphically, Arkham Origins holds up well, though it lacks the polish of the later entries. The new Batsuit design leans towards a more live-action look, which may divide fans used to the comic-inspired aesthetic of earlier games.

Technical issues, such as bugs and occasional frame drops, sometimes pull you out of the immersive experience, but the strong voice acting and sound design largely compensate.

### Conclusion

While **Batman Arkham Origins** may not reach the heights set by Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, it remains a worthwhile prequel that deepens Batman’s lore and offers a compelling, if rougher, take on the Dark Knight’s early vigilante days. Fans seeking a darker narrative and expanded Gotham will find plenty to enjoy despite its flaws. If you want to play the whole series from start, Definitely don't skip it.
