One handed gameplay, increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Six weapons all at once, all attacking simultaneously. That’s the basic gist of Brotato. For those familiar with the game Vampire Survivors, Brotato is essentially a welcome clone.

Both games are in the same genre of bullet-hell survival one handed roguelite games, but the two games couldn’t be more different from each other that Brotato stands well out on its own —- It has its own set of weapons, rules, mechanics, and progression design that make it a compelling alternative, or perhaps an even better game than Vampire Survivors.

Brotato is a gameplay first, ask questions later type of game. There is no story, no tutorials, but the game is relatively easy to pick up. Players select a Potato-looking character class out of the starting five (with more unlockable via progression), a starting weapon, and then unleashed upon the rectangular combat arena where they need to fend off alien monsters for a limited time and survive the wave.

After each wave ends, there is a short break, with the possibility of getting randomly upgraded by way of leveling to increase stats and purchasing to acquire weapons and items. This is as long as players have the resources — both obtainable by killing alien monsters — to level up or do purchases. Starting from one, up to six weapons can be held at the same time and everything attacks automatically with no buttons required. (the Potato has six hands apparently).

Brotato is an action-packed game top to bottom. As mentioned before, it boasts up to six weapons all firing and attacking simultaneously. That means SMGs, Rocket Launchers, Swords, Wands, can all be equipped by the character and used all at the same time. It results in a highly satisfying monster killing display that never gets boring. In addition, The sound effects are potent and the impacts are visually appealing, especially when you have hordes of alie monsters coming at you getting squashed, sliced, shot, and exploded by your unconventional combination of weapons.

In a rogue-lite manner, everything is reset upon dying, with the exception of unlocked characters and higher difficulty settings. and it’s not a very easy game to master. While killing aliens is simple enough to be done in one hand, dying is just as easy too, only requiring a few surprising hits and before you know it, you’re dead. I can’t count the times that I’ve unexpectedly died in this game due to one overconfident move or a careless misstep.

With this Android and iOS release, Brotato is looking better than ever and one of the best premium games for the Mobile platform right now. It’s fun, it's engaging, and it’s very cheap at $5.
