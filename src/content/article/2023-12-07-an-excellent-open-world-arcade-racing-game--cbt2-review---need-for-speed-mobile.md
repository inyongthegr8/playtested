‚ú®Overview

Need for Speed Mobile is an open-world arcade racing game made specifically for mobile, and an adaptation of one of the most popular video game racing franchises. The game is currently on a Closed Beta Test in limited regions only (Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico) that runs from 18:00:00 on December 6, 2023 (PST) to 18:00:00 on December 18, 2023 (PST).

This arcade-style open-world racing game aims to captivate players with its iconic Need for Speed elements, including high-speed races, police pursuits, and a ‚Äòrising to the challenge‚Äô storyline. The game features AAA-level graphics, simplified touch controls, and a unique open-world environment called Heat Bay, where players can engage in various challenges and activities.

üé®Graphics and Art Style

The graphics are as good as it can get for a mobile game, with AAA levels of fidelity I would expect from a big franchise such as Need for Speed. The detailing of car models and environments is commendable, and the game introduces minor destructible environments such as trees, fences, and street litter which all in all adds a bit to the immersion, especially in this open-world setting. Need for Speed Mobile also adapts and continues the trend set by Need for Speed Unbound, with stylized artistic Neon-Anime visual effects emanating from the cars to accentuate the action.

üéÆGameplay

Need for Speed Mobile is a racing game through and through, but more adapted to the mobile experience. The controls are much more simplified for a touch control scheme: automated acceleration with a dedicated button for drifting, and of course, it won‚Äôt be a proper Need for Speed without that patented Nitro Boost mechanics. The gameplay showcases solid arcade racing mechanics with engaging races and challenges throughout the map.

üåçOpen-World Free Roam

Heat Bay serves as a full-fledged open-world environment, providing players with freedom to explore, undertake challenges, and participate in various activities. This open-world feature distinguishes Need for Speed Mobile from other racing games, offering a dynamic and expansive backdrop for races and pursuits.

üèÅüöîRanked Races and Police Chases

The game is centered on two key modes; Ranked Races where you race in real-time against other players and Police Pursuit where you can play as a Racer trying to attract ‚Äúheat‚Äù for fun or a Police Car trying to capture a racer. This mode comes across as a bit too futuristic for my tastes, with EMP blast abilities, shields, and power-ups, but it‚Äôs nonetheless an interesting aspect that adds more to the game than just pure racing. There are also side mission elements such as Odd Jobs, Training modes; plus Track, Jump, and Speed Challenges which can keep players busy with its variety of engaging activities.

‚è´Progression

The progression is centered on the player going through the story missions and unlocking the game modes one by one, winning race after race, acquiring more cars, and upgrading them to perform better. The progression is reinforced by the opportunity to acquire better cars through gacha mechanics, adding a layer of excitement and customization to the journey.

üîßCustomization

Customization remains a key aspect of the game, beginning with the creation of your custom character and extending to extensive car customization, including color, performance tuning, and cosmetics. The game offers a wide range of options such as hubs, tires, paint, and wraps, enabling players to choose their favorite colors or create custom designs to make their cars stand out on the race tracks. Different currencies are available for accumulation, providing the means to enhance and personalize your cars.

üìäTechnical Performance

The game's performance on my Snapdragon 888 device is relatively decent, which is well above the minimum requirements (Snapdragon 710, Helio G70, Kirin 810, Exynos 9610). I was able to play at a high FPS setting, which likely translates to 60FPS, although it is not entirely free of slowdowns.

I experienced FPS drops, especially during open-world segments, and the multiplayer experience is not as smooth yet, featuring noticeable rubber banding and lag, particularly when encountering other players in races. In terms of stability, I have encountered no crashes so far, nor have I encountered major game-breaking bugs. However, it's essential to note that this review is based on the Dec 2023 'CBT2' and may not accurately reflect the quality of the finished product. There are rumors that the game will release on China this January, but don‚Äôt quote me on that.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

With a diverse range of activities, customization options, and engaging progression, Need for Speed Mobile is set to provide an immersive and enjoyable experience for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, offering a compelling combination of engaging arcade racing gameplay, impressive AAA-level graphics, and a well-designed open-world environment.
