Quasimorphosis

Test

Quasimorph is a mix of classic turn-based roguelike RPG with an extraction twist, where the player's progress and acquired loot depend on their survival in missions.


**Pros:**


+Engaging fusion of turn-based roguelike RPG and extraction mechanics.

+Methodical combat mechanics that reward strategic thinking

+Intricate inventory system and hardcore health mechanics.


**Cons:**


-Lack of a text-skipping feature, making dialogue frustrating

-Clunky character movement detracts from gameplay fluidity

-It‚Äôs hardcore difficulty is not for a lot of people

üìùNotable points: That these pros and cons are based on Demo build and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product

The title can be confusing as the game was originally called Quasimorphosis but has recently been changed to just Quasimorph. However, the game itself remains the same, with improvements and changes, particularly in the character's appearance and movement on the map.

Quasimorph's premise, involving a spreading disease, space stations, fever, and interdimensional demons, sets the stage for an intense and mysterious atmosphere. In Quasimorph, players would undertake missions within the infected space stations to uncover the dark secret behind the disease and the rifts to Bramphatur. The turn-based gameplay mechanics would allow for strategic decision-making, emphasizing the importance of planning and tactics to survive each encounter.

The graphics feature retro-inspired pixelated art that authentically replicates the visual style of the late 90s to the early 2000s. The game also incorporates 3D graphics and utilizes 2D isometric elements in certain aspects. It has this distinct tone that genuinely feels nostalgic, and brings you back to these golden days of gaming.  However, in contrast to the earlier footage of the game, the character sprite has been updated to include rotation and movement animations. Despite this improvement, I find that the movement feels somewhat jarring, resulting in a somewhat clunky gameplay experience.

The gameplay of Quasimorph is a top-down turn-based shooter that draws heavy inspiration from classic titles like Fallout 1 and 2. Players embark on missions with diverse objectives, and each level is procedurally generated, providing a unique experience with every playthrough. To control their character, players click on tiles to move, interact with objects, or attack hostile units. The combat mechanics are methodical, demanding strategic positioning and thorough preparation.

Ammo is scarce and reloading at the right time is essential. These elements combine to create intense and rewarding encounters against enemies, offering a sense of satisfaction after each battle. However, it's important to note that the game can become highly challenging, and players should expect frequent deaths. As a result, Quasimorph may not appeal to everyone, particularly those seeking a more casual gaming experience.

There is an inventory system where you can loot, equip, and interact with items. Additionally, the game incorporates a clever hardcore health system that tracks injuries for each body part. This is a hardcore element, as you need to stabilize wounds, patch them up, or maybe even counter infections with antibiotics. Inventory management plays a significant role in the gameplay, emphasizing the extraction-style mechanics.

Players must carefully consider what items to bring on missions, as they risk losing everything upon death. This aspect encourages strategic decision-making and prioritization, forcing players to assess the value of each item and determine what is worth bringing back if they survive the mission.

The extraction twist adds an extra layer of risk and reward to the game. If a player dies during a mission, they would lose everything they had acquired, adding a high-stakes element to the gameplay. However, if they manage to survive, they would be able to keep all the loot they gathered, providing the main progression element and incentive for surviving and completing missions.

I have only explored a small part of the game while playing the demo. However, the full game is designed to offer players the ability to explore other planetary bases, secret labs, and the wreckage of spaceships across the solar system using their ships. This exploration allows players to discover new technologies, abilities, and other items that can help them level the playing field during operations.

Now, onto my main gripes. The game is missing a significant quality-of-life feature: there is no option to skip through text to display everything instantly. You are left with two choices: either endure the painfully slow text scrolling or skip the entire dialogue altogether. It's surprising that such a feature was overlooked, almost as if nobody tested the game. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the game feels mechanically clunky when it comes to moving your character around the levels.

Conclusion:

Despite a couple of drawbacks in the demo, Quasimorph showcases its potential as an exciting and challenging gaming experience once it releases. The game's unique combination of genres, nostalgic atmosphere, and strategic gameplay mechanics makes it a novel idea for gamers seeking for something fresh. Quasimorph's Demo is now available for download on Steam for everyone to experience. The full release is set to arrive on August 17, 2023, with pricing details yet to be announced. With its captivating fusion of Fallout-style gameplay, roguelike elements, and extraction mechanics, Quasimorph has the potential to be a steal for players who appreciate this genre mash-up, especially if it falls under the $25 mark.
