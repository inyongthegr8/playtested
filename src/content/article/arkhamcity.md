title: Expanding the Dark Knight‚Äôs Playground | Batman Arkham City Review
game: Batman Arkham City
---

After the success of Arkham Asylum, **Batman Arkham City** took the Dark Knight‚Äôs adventures to an open-world playground inside a massive prison district of Gotham. This game was exactly what I hoped for, offering more freedom, diverse environments, and deeper gameplay without losing the series‚Äô signature atmosphere.

## Pros
- üèôÔ∏è Open-world design offers more freedom and variety  
- ü¶∏ Combat refined with new moves and multi-enemy counters  
- üê± Playable Catwoman sections add diversity  
- üîì Gradual unlocks keep progression engaging and balanced  
- üé® Art direction that still looks stunning years later  

## Cons
- üê¢ Slow initial pacing before the city opens up  
- üß© Riddler collectibles can be tedious and frustrating  
- üèôÔ∏è Still feels like one long continuous mission more than true sandbox 
- üìñ Story can be all over the place

Now here is basically what I dreamed the next game should be while I was playing Asylum. Which is to do Open World. It's not the whole Gotham City unlike Open World Spider-Man games getting New York, but Arkham City is a nice compromise nonetheless. The game is now open world, and I feel more free in playing as Batman now. More city street environments, gliding in open world, grappling hook to climb buildings, and jumping rooftop to rooftop. The chance to play as Catwoman from time to time is just icing on the cake. It started slow, probably a factor why I couldn't really get into it, but once the city opens up it becomes loads of fun.

Arkham City‚Äôs open-world design lets you truly feel like you‚Äôre patrolling Gotham. The city feels dense and alive with its crowded rooftops, streets, and alleys, all bursting with activity and side content. Gliding through the cityscape on Batman‚Äôs cape and climbing with the grappling hook are incredibly satisfying, giving you a real sense of power and freedom. 

However, it still gives that feeling that the game is very large one continuous quest/mission, and it still felt a little claustrophobic because I was kinda stranded to Arkham City and its momentous event. I hated the now more annoying Riddler collectibles too and never bothered with that, as the sheer volume of collectibles can feel tedious and grindy, pulling you away from the main narrative at times.

Combat has been polished further and much more fluid and easier to do combats, with new moves and counter mechanics that reward creativity, especially in larger groups. The ability to chain counters and fluidly transition between enemies makes fights feel exhilarating rather than repetitive. Multiple counters being my favorite added feature (similar to how it evolved in Assassin's Creed games). 

The progression is also super engaging and It was awesome unlocking new stuff and the pace to unlock things are done just right it never really feels grindy. Unlocking new gear feels meaningful and encourages exploration.

Adding playable Catwoman sections was a great move, offering fresh stealth gameplay with different mechanics and abilities. This variety keeps the experience interesting and adds narrative depth.

Graphics wise, playing it 11 years later, it really aged exceptionally well especially how the art style is. Playing it on the Steam Deck, it can still go toe to toe with modern titles as far as visuals go (not to mention gameplay too), especially in today's blurry TAA/upscaling infested AAA market. I even beat like the last few hours of the story on my PC on a big monitor at max graphics and it still looked impressive and really aged very well! Arkham Asylum's graphics isn't much different from this so if you're worried about visuals not holding up in 2024 and beyond, don't worry, it still holds up.

I do have some criticisms about the Story, it was all over the place. The main villain is severely underutilized in favor of yet again a more popular villain, who ends up dominating much of the narrative. All while unnecessarily shoehorning another popular villain as a key player as well, which can feel a bit forced or rushed, as if the game is trying to cram in as many iconic Batman characters as possible.

### Conclusion

**Batman Arkham City** successfully expands the series‚Äô formula into a vibrant urban playground while maintaining the core strengths of fluid combat, deep storytelling, and immersive stealth. It balances freedom and narrative in a way few superhero games have since. If Arkham Asylum set the stage, Arkham City truly lets you play the Dark Knight on your own terms.
