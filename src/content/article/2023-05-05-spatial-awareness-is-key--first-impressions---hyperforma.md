Hyperforma is a literal unique take on the Breakout puzzle formula, bounce around the levels, punch your way through the defenses, and hack the system in this unique puzzle game.

The story is simple and involves the player character, a lone explorer looking to find the “Princess” and his journey into an ancient cyberspace of a mysteriously vanished civilization. It is mostly told through a series of short minimalistic cutscenes and bits of dialogue with various entities you encounter. While the premise is intriguing, the actual plot is not particularly deep or memorable. That being said, the story is more of a backdrop for the puzzler gameplay than a main focus.

The gameplay in Hyperforma revolves around solving puzzles by moving and rotating geometric shapes. You can rotate the puzzle in all axes but the last one requires the use of two fingers. The whole gameplay formula of Breakout or Brick Breaker is literally spun in on itself by instead letting the player bounce around the screen, with the main ability to launch the user towards the center of the puzzle, hitting and breaking other obstacles, clearing the way towards the “core” of the puzzle.

The game starts off relatively easy, but quickly ramps up the difficulty as you progress through the levels and chapters. These puzzles require a mix of logic, spatial awareness and reflexes. There were several moments where I had to stop and really think about how to proceed instead of blindingly launching myself towards the center. While the gameplay is challenging, it never feels unfair or frustrating. Each puzzle feels like a gratifying achievement when you finally reach the center.

While the game is free-to-play, it is littered with intrusive ads that play every level or two. Besides that, there is also an option to watch ads to get better rewards, or just outright purchase the premium version for a cheap price of $5. Worth a try? yes if you like these kinds of puzzles and won't mind the ads for a zero cost experience.
