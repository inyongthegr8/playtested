Rainbow Six Mobile features the same PvP FPS experience that started with Rainbow Six Siege back in 2015, which has continuously been updated throughout the years with new content, operators, and changes.

Mechanically, Rainbow Six Mobile is a unique FPS game with distinct features that differentiate it from the oversaturated battle royale market that we currently have. It is a team-based PvP shooter, with a focus on player abilities, verticality, and destructible environments.

The destructible environments are the heart of Rainbow Six Mobile's gameplay, Walls, floors, and ceilings can be destroyed, allowing players to create new paths, sightlines, and unexpected strategies. Each round is a dynamic puzzle, where both attackers and defenders must adapt to changing circumstances, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Rainbow Six Mobile boasts a diverse roster of operators, each with their own special abilities and tactical gadgets. From hard breachers and gadget counters to intel gatherers and team support, the operators offer a wealth of tactical options. These operators are all unlockable via in-game grinding, so far the process is decently implemented, with a ticket system allowing players to try out these operators, one ticket at a time, until they eventually “recruit” them permanently to their rotation.

For this soft launch, It is now available in Canada for both iOS and Android, while the Soft Launch for other countries will go live starting with Mexico on September 4, with more coming next month, progression will finally be made permanent going into the full launch, so no more wipes or restarts as far as players are concerned.
