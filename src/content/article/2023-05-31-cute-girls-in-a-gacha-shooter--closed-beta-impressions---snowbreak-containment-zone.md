In Snowbreak: Containment Zone, the player assumes the role of an Adjutant, navigating the mysterious and devastated ‘containment zone’ while controlling a squad of waifu heroes with diverse skills, gun types, and abilities. The game features a gacha system for unlocking and acquiring new heroes, each with their own unique traits and tiers.

Currently in closed beta testing for the PC and Android platforms starting today, I had the opportunity to try out the PC version for a quick spin.

It almost started out like an Isekai-type story, with the protagonist waking up in the middle of the "containment zone". Thankfully, it isn't that way. Now we have an in-universe protagonist with a real background story. However, there is still a mystery that players have to unravel.

As an Adjutant, players have the opportunity to unlock and choose from a diverse selection of waifu heroes with various skills, gun types, and abilities. These weapon options include assault rifles, submachine guns, close-range shotguns, and sniper rifles, allowing players to tailor their gameplay style to their preferences.

Upon starting the game as a new player, you are already provided with three basic characters in the first few minutes, as well as trying out other hero types. These initial heroes offer a solid foundation for gameplay and allow players to familiarize themselves with the mechanics and dynamics of the game. As you progress and unlock more heroes through the gacha system, you can expand your squad and diversify your team's abilities.

Players can control one character at a time but switch seamlessly between the other two party members with a short cooldown, utilizing their individual strengths and abilities to tackle various enemies. Characters have two abilities, a standard ability and a special ability. Additionally, players can call upon the support ability of their squad members temporarily during combat. The seamless switching between squad members and the option to call for support during combat adds a layer of strategy and variety to gameplay.

The combat in Snowbreak: Containment Zone is highly satisfying, with responsive gunplay and impactful hits against enemies. Playing on PC with a keyboard and mouse, the game felt like a really well-made shooter, without any floaty controls whatsoever. The variety of weapon types, such as assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles, cater to different synergistic playstyles and allow players to adapt their approach to different combat situations.

As a gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency. Of course, not everything here is final but currently the gacha rates are too low for now. If you love collecting the best of the best characters, this might become a deal breaker. However, mechanically as a game and as a free-to-play experience, I find Snowbreak: Containment Zone highly enjoyable as a shooter, with fun gunplay, character switching, and cool abilities.
