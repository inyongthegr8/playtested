title: A visually stunning Gacha RPG | First Impressions - Brown Dust 2
---

Brown Dust 2, the somewhat both direct and spiritual successor to the popular Brave 9 / Brown Dust, takes players on a grander journey filled with time travel, world-traveling elements, and captivating narratives.

Developed with a unique HD-2D art style, Brown Dust 2 is a gacha RPG game that offers a visually stunning experience that combines detailed 2D artwork with beautiful 3D environments reminiscent of the acclaimed Octopath Traveler series.

The game expands upon the world established in its predecessor, Brave 9 (also called Brown Dust), while introducing new timelines and places. While the story is standalone, it references the time travel and world-traveling elements previously set up, adding variety and intrigue to the narrative.

Brown Dust 2 features turn-based combat with strategic tile-based positioning, adding a layer of tactical depth to battles. Players must carefully consider the positioning of their characters to optimize their skills and abilities, even utilizing skills such as knockback or AOE attacks, to further emphasize the position-based combat.

Assembling a team of companions characters is the main core aspect of the gameplay. These characters can be collected through various means, including gameplay progression, gacha mechanics, or in-app purchases. Each companion possesses unique abilities, skills, and attributes, allowing players to create diverse and powerful teams. The gacha element adds a familiar element of excitement and anticipation as players aim to obtain rare pulls, however in my experience it is not a hard requirement to progress in the game. It is worth noting that while the game incorporates waifu elements, it also includes male characters, providing a wide selection for players to choose from.

The inclusion of quality of life features, such as auto-walk to quest destinations and fast-forwarding dialogues, streamlines the gameplay experience, making it more convenient for players looking to skip parts that they want to skip. The inclusion of both horizontal and vertical gameplay modes enhances flexibility, allowing players to enjoy the game on both device orientations. It is not a seamless transition as you will need to restart the game to switch orientations, and constantly switching between two orientations can be jarring because of two different UI schemes.

Brown Dust 2 offers various localization options, including Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese, catering to a diverse player base. Additionally, players can choose between Japanese and Korean voice-over options, adding immersion and personalization to the gameplay experience.
