Tarisland embarks on a journey to capture the magic of classic MMOs while introducing its own twists. it currently has an on-going second closed beta test that runs from November 16 and will last for at least two weeks.

As of this CBT, there are nine characters to choose from: Barbarian Fighter,  Ranger,  Paladin,  Warrior, Phantom Priest, Mage, Priest, including the two new characters for this beta test phase:  Shadow Swordsman, and Phantom Necromancer.  Which is a pretty solid class lineup so far and probably covers all bases as far as player preferences go.

I was able to try both the Mage and Paladin classes, to get a feel of both the Melee and Ranged combat, so far, it really adopts a classic MMORPG style of gameplay, opting for a more grounded style of combat with moderate animations and less focus on movement.  You're free to rotate the camera, from a close-up third person view to a zoomed-out isometric style of play. It's possible. Although there is a fixed camera setting option for those who prefer it.

The introduction sequence and subsequent starting quests serve as a comprehensive tutorial, introducing players to all the features and gameplay elements of the game. These include movement, combat, mounts, exploration, questing, dungeons, raids, bosses, and even PvP.

The game seamlessly guides players through these various aspects in a natural way. For multiplayer components, it even gives you AI companions that integrate seamlessly with the story. For instance, the initial boss encounter and dungeons in the game feature AI teammates, simulating the experience of matchmaking with other players. It's a "show, don't tell" situation that works exceptionally well, especially for an MMORPG opting for a classic approach that might initially appear foreign to the newer generation players out there.

As for the itemization, it’s pretty standard, equip more items to increase your stats, and farm for better numbers. There’s no cosmetic change when equipping new gear though, so it’s entirely possible to go from level 1 to lets say level 30, without any cosmetic changes for your character, which is a bummer for those who like to customize the appearance of their characters, but this is where monetization comes in; you'd have to mostly spend real money if you want to customize the appearance of your character.
