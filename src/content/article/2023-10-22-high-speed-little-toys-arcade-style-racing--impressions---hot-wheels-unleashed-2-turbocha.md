The first game was one of my lowkey go-to racing games to play on the Steam Deck. Now it gets a sequel which honestly flew under my radar until its release recently. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is continuation of the original game with some noticeable improvements, especially in the gameplay and content.

The game tries to tell a story about massive monsters invading the city, which adds a narrative layer to the racing events. I find the story a bit disjointed though with the actual gameplay and racing parts of the game, which is probably 99% of the game, fortunately.

Content wise, there are a lot of subtle gameplay enhancements. New vehicle types and classes such as Off-Road and Drifters, or ATVs and Bikes are added. There is also a new type of race called Waypoint, which is completely offtrack and is set throughout the five environments in the game: Gas Station, Mini-Golf, Museum, Arcade, and Backyard.

Gameplay wise, two new abilities are added to spice up the action: Jumping and sideways dashes. Jumping to go over track gaps, obstacles, and enemies, and dashes for better maneuverability and  to bump enemies to the sides.

Overall, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged feels very similar to it's predecessor. With similar graphics and arcade racer feel to it. Just with enough improvements that it gets a pass from being a full-on sequel instead of being an expansion, DLC, or a mere update. If you love the first game, then this is no question a must buy for you. If you're just looking for a Hot Wheels racing experience on a video game, then look no further, no need to play the first.
