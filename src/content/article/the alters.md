title: An Unexpected Thought Provoking Surprise | The Alters Review
game: The Alters
---

**The Alters** surprised me as one of the most compelling strategy/survival games this year. At first glance, it reminded me of Fallout Shelter or XCOM, but it quickly reveals deeper, thought-provoking themes wrapped inside an addictive base-building experience.

## Pros
- 🏗️ Deep, rewarding base-building mechanics with plenty of player freedom  
- 🧠 Social survival elements and existential storylines that add depth  
- 🎨 Unique art style with strong atmospheric world-building  
- ⚙️ Engaging resource management that keeps gameplay fresh  
- 💡 Exploration of cloning and alternate realities provides a rich narrative backdrop  

## Cons
- 🖥️ Performance issues on PC, with some stuttering even on high-end rigs  
- 🔍 Visual polish uneven, with some UE5 jankiness present  
- 📉 Blurry visuals on console despite smooth frame rates

The core gameplay loop of constructing and managing a sustainable base keeps you hooked for hours. You’re constantly balancing resources, managing colonists, and expanding your operations, which scratches that strategic itch perfectly. The social survival mechanics add layers of complexity and unpredictability, requiring thoughtful decisions that affect not just your base but also your characters’ mental states and relationships.

The narrative tackles heavy themes like cloning and existential crises with surprising maturity and nuance. It’s rare to find a strategy game that weaves such philosophical topics into its gameplay and story, and The Alters pulls it off effectively.

Visually, the game has a distinct style that, while not perfect, creates a compelling atmosphere. Performance on PC can be inconsistent, with noticeable stuttering even on machines that should handle the game smoothly. The Xbox Series X version runs better but suffers from blurrier visuals.

Despite these technical flaws, the gameplay and story carry the experience strongly, making The Alters a memorable and addictive title that’s well worth your time.

### Conclusion

The Alters is a unique blend of base-building strategy and deep, existential storytelling that sets it apart from typical survival games. Though hampered by some performance and visual issues, its addictive gameplay and thought-provoking themes make it a standout release that I found hard to put down.
