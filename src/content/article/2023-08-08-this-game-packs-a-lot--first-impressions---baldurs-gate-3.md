Baldur's Gate 3, an epic RPG developed by Larian Studios and building on the legacy of the iconic Baldur's Gate series, was released in early access in 2020 and was met with an overwhelmingly positive response, reinvigorating interest in D&D-based video games. Larian Studios embraced the complexities of D&D's 5th Edition, creating a game that felt akin to playing the tabletop version virtually, for better and for worse. The vast world, intricate systems, and captivating storytelling that come with the experience of D&D are promised, resonating with long-time fans and newcomers alike. Now, three years later, Baldur’s Gate 3 is officially out on PC.

The game allows players to create their protagonist from a selection of different races, classes, and backgrounds. Players can choose from various races such as humans, elves, dwarves, and tieflings, among others, and different classes like fighter, wizard, cleric, rogue, and ranger. Character choices influences abilities, skills, and unique dialogue options throughout the game.

Aside from a custom character, the initial core cast of characters are also all available to be selected as a main character. The core characters that were not selected will become NPCs and companions in the game’s story, with their own stories unfolding along with the player, as well as the chance to die, depending on the choices of the player.

The game's open-ended story presents branching storylines and consequences, offering a deeply immersive narrative experience. Combat is highly tactical, requiring strategic thinking to overcome challenges. The polished graphics, coupled with an amazing soundtrack, create a captivating and atmospheric world. Both keyboard/mouse and controller users enjoy well-designed UIs, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gameplay experience. Moreover, the game supports cooperative multiplayer with split-screen functionality, enhancing the fun of adventuring together.

Overall, the game was well-received by players and critics alike. The developers, Larian Studios, were praised for their commitment to staying true to the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset and the authentic role-playing experience they delivered. Personally, I enjoyed the depth of character creation, the interactive storytelling with varying outcomes, skill-checked dialogues, and the deep strategic turn-based combat.
