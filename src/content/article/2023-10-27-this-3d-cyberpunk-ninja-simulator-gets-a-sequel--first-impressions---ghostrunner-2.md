Ghostrunner 2 is an exciting sequel to the original Ghostrunner released in 2020, which kind a took some spotlight out of Cyberpunk 2077 especially with its similar themes, the sequel builds on the elements that made the first game great while introducing new features and gameplay mechanics.

As a sequel, the game features intense one-hit-kill katana combat mechanics now with block and stamina mechanics, a deeper exploration of the world outside the tower, nonlinear levels with complex motorbike segments, exciting new mode, and interactive boss fights. The sequel also places a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.

The game is essentially a 3D cyberpunk ninja simulator, and it excels in making you feel like a cybernetically enhanced badass. The parkour segments involve wallrunning, railgrinding, grapple hooking, and pole swinging, and they introduce an impressive variety of challenges and mix them up with each other along with your abilities. The level design is carefully crafted to demand precise movements, creating an exhilarating flow as you traverse the environment. In some instances, you'll need to mix parkour with your special abilities, adding a layer of complexity and puzzle-solving to the parkour traversal sections.

Perhaps my favorite in the game is the inclusion of a secret roguerunner.exe mode (unlocked by progressing through the Main Story) where it takes on the form of a roguelike game with high replayability thanks to its dynamic and randomized factors. In this mode, players are presented with four distinct stages, each consisting of a series of challenging nodes, some involving parkour and others combat. The challenges start off relatively manageable and gradually increase in difficulty as you progress through the stage.
