In a surprising departure from the series' established norm of being known for its renowned fighting games, BlazBlue Entropy Effect boldly ventures into uncharted territory with its unique take on the roguelite genre, albeit a bit strangely done.

At the core of BlazBlue Entropy Effect lies an addictive gameplay loop that seamlessly intertwines side-scrolling action with the exploratory nature of Metroidvania games. The game features four meticulously designed level types—Night City, Ruins, Research Base, and Sakura City—each presenting distinct challenges, bosses, and enemy types to conquer.

The character roster, featuring seven BlazBlue characters: Ragna, Hibiki, Mai, Hakumen, Noel, Kokonoe, and Λ-No.11, with one more slated as coming soon. Each of the characters have their own movesets and weapons that range from swords, spears, to even guns. And I found all of the movesets awesome and fun to use. The combat mechanics, although not flawlessly fluid, deliver impactful blows that empower players to engage effectively. This impact, coupled with a carefully maintained balance between challenging boss encounters and regular enemy confrontations, ensures that players remain invested and motivated to hone their skills.

The progression is a typical roguelite setup of random upgrades and choices every area clear, and is sprinkled with novel mechanics to spice up the roguelite experience. The story is a bit nonsensical, and doesn't really mesh the Blazblue and roguelite premise very well. However, you can just easily ignore it in exchange for the exceptional combat gameplay.
