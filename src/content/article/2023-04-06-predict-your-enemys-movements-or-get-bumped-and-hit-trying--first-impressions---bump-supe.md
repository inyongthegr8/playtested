BUMP! Superbrawl’s concept is simple. Predict the enemies movements, one turn, one hero at a time and win the match. Either by scoring higher or knocking their heroes out, every match is very exciting and satisfying to win.

A team of three assorted heroes plus three in reserve is commanded by the player and pitted against another team in 1v1 competitive matches. The gameplay is relatively simple. Players are only allowed one character to move per turn, and the only action they can do is to move their character and attack in a certain direction right after (depending on the character). After only 1 to 2 rounds of gameplay, I already got the concept and was already ready for some serious battle.

After a turn is confirmed, both sides' moves will play out at the same time, leading to some interesting predictive combat movements — kind of like Battleship — either you hit enemy units, he hits yours, or both hit each other. Each hero will have HP that when depleted, will cause them to get knocked out and replaced by their reserve hero.

Then, the characters who just performed the moves will have to rest for 1 round, giving the floor off to the other two of the players’ characters. It leads to some strategic positional gameplay, where you leave your heroes to rest will matter as well. It can make them vulnerable, or you can use them as bait for other heroes to utilize

There are many different game modes and levels to play in that are unlockable. Each with their own gimmicks that will mean a different objective or map elements to utilize. Pure KO matches, exploding and poison barrels littering the map, a capture the “zone” game mode, a coin gathering game mode, and much more. The levels are also rotating every certain amount of hours, so not all sessions are the same every day. Making the game highly varied on a day to day basis.

The progression overall — free-to-play wise — felt very accessible and easy to advance in. In my first few hours of play I already unlocked quite a few heroes of my own, as opposed to other games locking you to a specific set of heroes for a long time, unless you can spend real money. The levels are also locked at the start but are easily obtainable.

As I said, After only 1 to 2 rounds of gameplay, I already got the concept and was already ready for some serious battle, BUMP! Superbrawl is that easy to pick-up. Mastering the predictive turn-based combat however, is another story. Coupled with the welcoming progression system that doesn't really feel grindy and the lack of play limiting systems in place, BUMP! Superbrawl is indeed a very enticing game that our strategic-inclined mobile gamers might enjoy all day.
