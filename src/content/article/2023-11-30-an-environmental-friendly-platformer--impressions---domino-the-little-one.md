Saving the world is cool, facing monsters is badass, but doing both at the same time? DOMINO: The Little One is a 2D platformer game aims to do just that. Well, the game promises to be an immersive interactive narrative experience that will test your wit and determination. Is it? Does it?

Sad to say, but it's not --- and it doesn't.  The game falls flat as a video game experience; the gameplay is very shallow: just move, run, and jump, and even with that simple scheme the character is awful to control. The game is very short under 40 minutes and there's really no challenge nor compelling reason to play it.

What's nice though is the hand drawn art style and the pro-environmental message it conveys. However this could have been done easily with a short series of videos instead. Having said all that, the game is completely free-to-play, no in-game ads or purchases, so the intent is really noble, just wasn't executed very well as a video game.
