Aether Gazer is a Action RPG gacha game set in a virtual world where humans have transcended into after a catastrophic war and have since forgotten their true origins. Players take on the role of the administrator of “Aether Gazer''. Fighters called Modifiers are tasked to protect this virtual world from corrupted beings called Visbanes.

Aether Gazer offers a wide array of playable characters to collect, each with their unique designs, personalities, and abilities. With all the waifu games coming out lately, it’s worth noting that this is not one of them, as it also features male characters to collect. The characters are beautifully designed with anime-inspired art style, featuring elaborate costumes, expressive facial features, and eye-catching animations.

As said earlier, these fighter characters are called Modifiers, and are obtained by playing the game and through a gacha system. You can upgrade these characters in a traditional RPG system commonly seen in mobile gacha games,

The combat in Aether Gazer combines real-time hack and slash action with role-based abilities and strategic team compositions. The game features fluid and dynamic animations that bring the characters and their abilities to life, effectively capturing the over-the-top kinetic feel of anime. Each character's attacks, skills, and ultimate abilities are visually distinct and impactful, providing a sense of weight and power during combat. The on-screen touch controls of the game are also commendable, as they are smooth and responsive.

Before the start of missions, you have the option to select up to three characters to accompany you and designate a team leader whom you will control. Different characters will possess unique synergies with each other, particularly in terms of how the team's ultimate skill is activated. You can advance through various chapters, completing missions one at a time.

Ultimately, progression in the game boils down to your character's level, stats, and slightly, the extent of your skill. You can level up your character, enhance their tier level through transcendence, and upgrade their skills, abilities, perks, and stats, to be able to progress into higher missions. Naturally, there is the option to spend money to expedite your progress and gain an advantage more rapidly.

As a gacha game, Aether Gazer includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, premium currency, and a generous energy system to limit play — nothing out of the ordinary. However, as a free-to-play experience, I find the game highly enjoyable, especially if you have a genuine appreciation for the fluid combat mechanics and are willing to invest more time and embrace the added challenge that comes from playing F2P.
