I played the Demo of the newly released game titled Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars Chapter 0. The Demo is monikered “Chapter 0” and is meant to introduce us to the Voice of Cards trilogy which started in 2021 and ended in 2022, now recently released for the Mobile platform. More specifically, Chapter 0 serves as a prelude to the first game in the series. It is only a short demo and I was pretty done after an hour or so.


**Pros:**


+Table-top RPG based aesthetic and gameplay

+Engaging turn-based combat system

+Free to try


**Cons:**


-non-table-top RPG players might find the game slow

Chapter 0 starts with a very welcoming tone coming from the narrator, or the “gamemaster” in table-top terms, introducing us to the world and its mechanics. Immediately, fans of the table-top RPG will appreciate its card-based aesthetic and similarities to the table-top setup.

Basically everything in this game is represented by cards. The characters, settings, and the world. The story opens with a group of white-robed trio of adventurers being given an important quest by the Queen’s in exchange for rewards. The queen gives us valuable information to jumpstart our search and sends us out to the world.

Soon after, I was battling monsters in the wilderness in a traditional card game turn-based format, animated to show a bit of eye candy; stumbled upon a town, talked to villagers, and investigated what the Queen wanted and where.

The combat is engaging enough, it mostly resembles a turn-based combat system, but every combatant is a card. Every character has their own deck of cards which are their available moves and skills. Typically, players select one move such as an attack or a powerful spell, which may or may not need gems to activate (don’t worry this is not a premium currency). There are six different elements that counteract each other to add even more depth.

The playthrough has been very immersive as a Table-top RPG experience albeit it can be a slow paced ordeal especially for non-table-top RPG players. I moved around a game piece to maneuver my party around a table-top collection of face-down cards representing the game world, and every movement I make reveals the faces of surrounding cards in a fog-of-war fashion. Putting the game piece or characters, item chests, or establishments will initiate an interaction such as talking, looting, or shopping.

Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars Chapter 0 is a really immersive experience, and I’m positive many Table-top RPG fans will love it. I’m looking forward to playing the full game and the succeeding games in the trilogy. It’s free to try, so if you’re a sucker for Table-top RPG games, I highly recommend it.
