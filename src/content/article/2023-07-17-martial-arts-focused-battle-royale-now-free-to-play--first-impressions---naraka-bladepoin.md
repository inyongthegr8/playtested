NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a online multiplayer game offers a fresh take on the battle royale formula, introducing unique martial arts-based mechanics that set it apart from its competitors. Players take on the role of powerful heroes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. The game is available for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, with an official mobile version coming soon as well.

The game offers a diverse roster of heroes to choose from, with a progression system to unlock most of them. The combat system in the game is skill-based with a focus on melee engagements but still offers the choice to use ancient ranged weapons. Players can engage in intense duels using a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, and even firearms like portable cannons or archers.

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT offers a gameplay experience focused on high mobility, making it perfect for fast-paced melee action where you can swiftly engage or disengage from enemies. The parkour system in the game is both intuitive and enjoyable, allowing you to navigate the map with ease, vertically or horizontally. You can climb towers, structures, cliffs, rocks, and even utilize grappling hooks to move around swiftly. The movement system feels intuitive and responsive, giving players a sense of freedom and agency in their actions.
