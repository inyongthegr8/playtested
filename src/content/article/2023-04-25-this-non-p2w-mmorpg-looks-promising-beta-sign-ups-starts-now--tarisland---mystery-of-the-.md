Tarisland - Mystery of the Hollows, or just Tarisland, is an upcoming MMORPG game from Tencent that is looking mighty promising. It is set to be released for both PC and Mobile (Android and iOS) with full cross-platform play.

Graphics wise, the game looks phenomenal with AAA-level of visuals; featuring lush jungles, snowy mountains, exotic landscape, and floating cities; A style that closely resembles World of Warcraft (and it even looks better than that) with themes of high fantasy including the archetypical magic beings and heroic character classes.

The game will feature seven character classes to choose from: Ranger, Paladin, Warrior, Mage, Priest, Bard, and Barbarian Fighter. They are as standard as far as standard goes, but its making sure that players are already familiar with what they're choosing even before playing the game.

So far, the trailer showed action-packed combat gameplay featuring cooperative boss fights against a dragon and a gigantic sea creature. These will probably be high level raids that players can take on to gain massive rewards, requiring teamwork and party synergy to accomplish.

Tarisland is set to disrupt the live service mobile gaming scene with the promise of being a "non-P2W" title, meaning there is absolutely no way to increase the power of your characters from in-app purchases. Usually with these kinds of games, cosmetics will become the main revenue streams, similar to highly successful PC games like League of Legends or Valorant.

There is no firm release date yet for the game, but it is looking like its coming real soon, probably this year or the next. There are plans for a beta test and the game is current accepting applications for the next playtest, so you might want to sign-up now if you're interested in getting early access.
