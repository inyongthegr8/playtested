**Doom: Dark Ages** is a return to the franchise‚Äôs classic roots but with a medieval twist, delivering fast-paced, brutal shooter gameplay with a focus on smooth flow and intense combat encounters. It strips away much of the complexity found in recent Doom titles, favoring streamlined mechanics that emphasize player skill and raw action.

From the outset, the game wastes no time throwing players into relentless battles against hordes of demons. as you‚Äôre greeted with combat that feels fluid and exhilarating. The flow of switching between weapons and engaging enemies is smoother than in Doom Eternal, with less fuss and more immediacy. No more switching to the chainsaw just because you needed more ammo, or having to use the flamethrower to get more armor, or having to use widely different weapon types because enemies have hard weakness or defense to specific types. Here in Dark Ages, the combat feels fast but approachable, without the complexity and weapon juggling that some players find tedious. All weapons are effective against all enemies, with only minor differences in efficiency. Ultimately, it all boils down to how you want to have fun,

Level design is tight and semi-open, offering enough exploration without feeling bloated or directionless. The encounters balance large enemy hordes with strategic opportunities to utilize different combat styles and weapon stances. While maps are compact and focused, they‚Äôre packed with secrets, alternate paths, and hidden caches that reward thorough exploration that doesn't feel tedious or a chore to do. It just came naturally for me to explore these extra areas.

One of the game‚Äôs strongest features is its ultra-fast loading times, which maintain gameplay momentum and reduce downtime. and It always amazes me to click continue only to be in-game in 1-2 seconds, and I'm playing mostly on PC so it didn't have any advantages of any console SSD optimization. This applies to checkpoints, moving over to the next level, or loading a game. This, combined with polished combat animations and visceral gore effects, creates a short but satisfying loop that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

The enemy variety is classic Doom, with familiar demons returning alongside some new threats. Each enemy type requires different tactics, but as I've said, are all within killable means with every weapon. and The game's roster of weapons is interesting and fun to use, and I found myself switching between them by choice, not because the game forced me to for a mechanical advantage. The game's pivot to a medieval theme is one of its greatest strengths. Far from being a negative, it serves as a refreshing departure from the series' traditional sci-fi backdrop, while still cleverly integrating the futuristic elements fans expect. And it's not like they shifted to Medieval out of nowhere, as they already have shown some medieval elements in the previous two games anyway.

The game keeps encounters fresh by mixing enemy compositions and terrain challenges, especially by also including segments or levels where you instead mount a cybernetic dragon in third person mode, engaging in high-speed aerial combat. The controls are straightforward: holding the fire button unleashes a continuous barrage of attacks, while a dedicated dodge button allows for swift evasions. Players also have the opportunity to pilot the Atlan mech, a towering war machine equipped with formidable weaponry, emphasizing the mech's massive scale and destructive power. Despite the initial excitement, I found both of these segments to be a bit basic and lacking refinement, but it serves its purpose, which is to be a palette cleanser within the game itself and provide some additional variety.
</div>
With regards to the platforming, in which I absolutely hated in Doom: Eternal, it is now toned down here and designed way better, they made the the experience feel more straightforward, accessible, and the movements are faster and easier, focusing on pure combat rather than navigation challenges. Overall, the game‚Äôs platforming is well tuned, offering challenges that reward mastery without becoming frustrating. 

Graphically, Doom: Dark Ages doesn't look much different but the previous two Doom titles, but it does consume significantly more resources because of the forced RT. Despite of that harsher but still reasonable requirements, some textures and character models still feels dated compared to modern shooters or even contemporaries in the same engine like Wolfenstein II or Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Although, this stylistic choice complements the fast gameplay and nostalgic vibe anyway. While the game maintains Doom‚Äôs trademark gore and demon designs, the human characters and faces fall short, giving off a cartoonish vibe that detracts from the otherwise gritty atmosphere. The sound design is punchy and atmospheric, with iconic weapon sounds and the usual heavy metal soundtrack that fuel the game‚Äôs intensity.

**Doom: Dark Ages** stands out as a refined, fast-paced shooter that successfully blends classic Doom gameplay with modern sensibilities.
