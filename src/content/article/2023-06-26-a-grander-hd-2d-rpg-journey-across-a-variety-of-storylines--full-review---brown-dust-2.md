BrownDust2 - Adventure RPG

lyndonguitar
PC Version

Brown Dust 2, the somewhat both direct and spiritual successor to the popular Brave 9 / Brown Dust, takes players on a grander journey filled with time travel, world-traveling elements, and captivating narratives.


**Pros:**


+Stunning HD-2D Graphics

+Strategic Turn-Based Combat

+Waifu elements while still having male characters to collect

+Diverse localization options (english, japanese, korean, chinese text; japanese and korean voice-overs)

+Quality of life features such as auto-walk and supports both portrait and landscape modes


**Cons:**


-Limited story focus by having multiple unrelated story packs instead of one connected grand story

-Performance issues

Developed with a unique HD-2D art style, Brown Dust 2 is a gacha RPG game that offers a visually stunning experience that combines detailed 2D artwork with beautiful 3D environments reminiscent of the acclaimed Octopath Traveler series.

Brown Dust 2 expands upon the world established in its predecessor, Brave 9 (also called Brown Dust), while introducing new timelines and places. While the story is standalone, it references the time travel and world-traveling elements previously set up, adding variety and intrigue to the narrative.

The main story is set in the continent of Svern, which was once under the rule of the Karian Empire but now faces an impending war and the encroaching shadow of dark magic. The fate of the Five Kingdoms hangs in the balance, with tensions rising and the peaceful Lugo village under threat.

However, there are many other story packs in various timelines that offer players a diverse range of adventures, allowing them to explore different facets of the game's lore. It is worth mentioning that some players may miss the continuation of the story from Brave 9, particularly the mercenary characters featured in that game, especially after being featured as a slight nod in the game’s tutorial segment.

Brown Dust 2 shines with its breathtaking HD-2D graphics. The fusion of highly detailed 2D character artwork and 3D environments creates a visually stunning world that draws players into the game's universe and is a good blend of retro and modernity. The flashy skill animations for each character bring battles to life with dynamic and visually pleasing effects. The art style, reminiscent of Octopath Traveler, showcases meticulous attention to detail, showered with modern visual effects like motion blur, bloom, and impressive artwork.

Brown Dust 2 features turn-based combat with strategic tile-based positioning, adding a layer of tactical depth to battles. Players must carefully consider the positioning of their characters to optimize their skills and abilities, even utilizing skills such as knockback or AOE attacks, to further emphasize the position-based combat.

Assembling a team of companions characters is the main core aspect of the gameplay. These characters can be collected through various means, including gameplay progression, gacha mechanics, or in-app purchases. Each companion possesses unique abilities, skills, and attributes, allowing players to create diverse and powerful teams. The gacha element adds a familiar element of excitement and anticipation as players aim to obtain rare pulls, however in my experience it is not a hard requirement to progress in the game. It is worth noting that while the game incorporates waifu elements, it also includes male characters, providing a wide selection for players to choose from.

The semi-open world exploration in Brown Dust 2 sets it apart from other gacha games. Instead of a linear level-based mission design, players can freely explore the game world, encountering various quests and challenges along the way. This exploration aspect adds freedom to the gameplay, allowing players to appreciate the HD-2D world even more.

The inclusion of quality of life features, such as auto-walk to quest destinations and fast-forwarding dialogues, streamlines the gameplay experience, making it more convenient for players looking to skip parts that they want to skip. The inclusion of both horizontal and vertical gameplay modes enhances flexibility, allowing players to enjoy the game on both device orientations. It is not a seamless transition as you will need to restart the game to switch orientations, and constantly switching between two orientations can be jarring because of two different UI schemes.

Brown Dust 2 incorporates the familiar gacha system found in many mobile RPG games. Players can acquire new companions and items through summons using in-game currency or premium resources. The gacha system adds a collectible aspect to the game, enticing players to aim for rare and powerful characters. While the gacha element may appeal to some players, it is important to note that the game can be enjoyed without spending real money. As a free-to-play experience, Brown Dust 2 provides enjoyable gameplay for those willing to invest time and embrace the challenge that comes with playing without additional purchases.

The game offers various localization options, including Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese, catering to a diverse player base. Additionally, players can choose between Japanese and Korean voice-over options, adding immersion and personalization to the gameplay experience.

While I haven’t personally experienced this myself, it is worth mentioning that some players have reported performance issues on certain devices. These issues include sluggishness, increased battery consumption, occasional crashes, and bugs. The game's demanding nature on hardware may pose challenges for some players. However, it is important to note that performance can vary depending on device specifications and software configurations. Developers may actively address these issues through updates to improve the overall gameplay experience.

Conclusion:

Brown Dust 2 offers a captivating gacha RPG adventure with its stunning HD-2D graphics, strategic turn-based combat, and expansive story packs for players to explore. Despite the technical issues for some players. The game's overall quality, gameplay mechanics, accessibility options, and free-to-play experience make it an enjoyable choice for fans of gacha RPGs.
