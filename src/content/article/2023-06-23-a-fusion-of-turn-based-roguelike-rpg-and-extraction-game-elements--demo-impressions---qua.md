Quasimorph is a mix of classic turn-based roguelike RPG with an extraction twist, where the player's progress and acquired loot depend on their survival in missions.

The gameplay of Quasimorph is a top-down turn-based shooter that draws heavy inspiration from classic titles like Fallout 1 and 2. Players embark on missions with diverse objectives, and each level is procedurally generated, providing a unique experience with every playthrough. To control their character, players click on tiles to move, interact with objects, or attack hostile units. The combat mechanics are methodical, demanding strategic positioning and thorough preparation. Ammo is scarce and reloading at the right time is essential. These elements combine to create intense and rewarding encounters against enemies, offering a sense of satisfaction after each battle.

There is an inventory system where you can loot, equip, and interact with items. Additionally, the game incorporates a clever hardcore health system that tracks injuries for each body part. This is a hardcore element, as you need to stabilize wounds, patch them up, or maybe even counter infections with antibiotics.

If a player dies during a mission, they would lose everything they had acquired, adding a high-stakes element to the gameplay. However, if they manage to survive, they would be able to keep all the loot they gathered, providing the main progression element and incentive for surviving and completing missions.

I have only explored a small part of the game while playing the demo. However, the full game is designed to offer players the ability to explore other planetary bases, secret labs, and the wreckage of spaceships across the solar system using their ships. This exploration allows players to discover new technologies, abilities, and other items that can help them level the playing field during operations.
