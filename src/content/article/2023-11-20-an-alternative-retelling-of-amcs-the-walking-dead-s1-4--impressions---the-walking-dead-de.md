The Walking Dead: Destinies invites players to embark on an alternative retelling of the iconic AMC television series' Season 1 to 4, now out for PC, Consoles, and Switch. Players will take control of various characters from the AMC series, whether friend or foe, ranging from Rick to the Governor. Their choices will shape the destiny of a team of characters from AMC's The Walking Dead series, altering the course of the story and revealing the diverse outcomes that certain choices can bring—outcomes that fans may have always imagined.

This aspect basically the only interesting aspect of this game, and all good things about this game end here.  The game falls short due to dated visuals, buggy gameplay, and lackluster presentation.

The graphics are notably subpar, resembling a PS3 game, and the storytelling relies on moving stills with voiceovers, contributing to an overall lack of quality presentation. The gameplay, structured as a third-person action experience, suffers from clunky mechanics and various game-breaking bugs, with some issues requiring multiple restarts to address. Despite the promise of altering the narrative through choices, the game struggles to fully capitalize on this unique aspect.
