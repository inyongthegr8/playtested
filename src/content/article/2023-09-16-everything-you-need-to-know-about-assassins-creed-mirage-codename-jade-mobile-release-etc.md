Assassin's Creed Mirage is generating a renewed interest in the series due to its promise of returning to the series' classic roots. Unlike recent entries that emphasized open-world exploration and RPG elements, Mirage aims to provide a more linear and story-driven experience. For fans who have longed for the days of parkour, stealth, and close-quarter combat, this return to basics is a welcome back change.

🕌Setting

🕌Setting

The game's primary setting is 9th-century Baghdad during a turbulent period. The chaotic yet vibrant streets of Baghdad will serve as the canvas for the game's narrative, as players navigate its alleys, rooftops, and bustling markets. Despite its striking resemblance and homage to the setting of the first game, it's important to note that this isn't a rehash of previous game settings, as the first game featured Israel, Palestine, and Syria instead.

🗡️Character

🗡️Character

It follows the journey of Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character very familiar to those who have played Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The game serves as Basim's “Origin Story” transforming from a street thief into a full-fledged member of the Assassin Brotherhood. This Brotherhood is dedicated to the pursuit of peace and liberty and stands in opposition to the Templar Order, whose vision of peace involves control and authority.

🎮Gameplay

🎮Gameplay

Mirage is designed to recapture the essence of earlier Assassin's Creed titles, focusing on core gameplay elements that have defined the series. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth mechanics take center stage, offering players a more linear and story-focused experience compared to recent RPG-heavy entries.

One new showcased feature is the introduction of the "Assassin Focus" ability. This unique skill allows Basim to eliminate multiple enemies simultaneously through instantaneous stealth assassinations, provided he remains undetected. Time slows down after each assassination, allowing for precise targeting of the next enemy. This is similar to a Chain Assassination Skill first seen in Assassin's Creed: Origins and in some capacity in Assassin's Creed: Liberation. Personally, I have some minor gripes about how this isn’t exactly going back to the roots, but I think this is a fun feature nonetheless that will make the game more accessible to players.

There are refinements in movement and running animations that ensure a fluid and dynamic parkour experience, though it's hard to ignore that it feels somewhat barebones, and I can't help but think that Assassin's Creed: Unity still did it better. Currently, it represents a great 'back to basics' approach, with a parkour system reminiscent of the first few Assassin’s Creed games, but I hope to see more dynamic parkour animations in future iterations. The combat on the other hand seems like a mix of RPG style AC and old school AC, but we’ll have to play it ourselves to really see what it’s like.

📱Release (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Mobile)

📱Release (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Mobile)

Assassin's Creed Mirage is slated for release on October 5 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and the iPhone 15 Pro, making it one of the most eagerly awaited releases of the year.

In a surprising move, Assassin's Creed Mirage will be making its way to the iPhone 15 Pro, marking a remarkable step forward for mobile gaming.  The success of AAA gaming on mobile could potentially change player expectations. Gamers may become more willing to pay for high-quality experiences, leading to a shift in the mobile gaming landscape.

Assassin's Creed Mirage and other upcoming AAA mobile titles will serve as important test cases. The success or failure of these games in terms of sales and player reception will provide valuable insights into the viability of AAA gaming on mobile.

⚔️Codename Jade

⚔️Codename Jade

if you're confused, Assassin's Creed Mirage is different from the also upcoming Assassin's Creed game: Codename Jade, which is a full-pledged mobile game specifically designed for Android and iOS.

Mirage's availability on Consoles, PC, and the iPhone 15 Pro positions it as a premium gaming experience, with the potential to redefine the standards for AAA gaming on mobile. In contrast, Codename Jade is set to be a full-fledged mobile game accessible to a wider range of mobile phones, aiming to provide an authentic Assassin's Creed experience optimized for touch controls.

Both titles offer exciting prospects for fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise, catering to different preferences and platforms. As we eagerly anticipate their respective releases, it's an exciting time for both traditional and mobile gaming enthusiasts, promising a diverse array of adventures in the Assassin's Creed universe.
