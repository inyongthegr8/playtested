title: Just Like The Movies, Might Even Be Better | Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Review
game: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
---

**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** initially raised some skepticism for me because of its first-person perspective, especially compared to the third-person action-adventure games like Uncharted that I prefer. However, I was proven wrong, as the first-person viewpoint here works remarkably well, creating a more immersive and personal experience that brings you closer to Indy’s world. 

## Pros
- 🕵️ Engaging first-person puzzles that feel natural and rewarding  
- 🤜 Combat style that captures the clumsy, scrappy feel of Indiana Jones  
- 🐍 Atmospheric environments that bring the adventure to life  
- 🎮 Passable stealth mechanics that complement the action  
- 🎵 Strong audio design with thematic music and voice acting  

## Cons
- 🐢 Stealth feels rudimentary and underdeveloped compared to other aspects  
- 📉 Some pacing issues early on that slow momentum  
- ⚙️ Occasional technical rough edges and AI glitches

Exploration is at the heart of this game. The first-person perspective lets you inspect puzzles and environments up close, enhancing the feeling of discovery and tension. The puzzles strike a balance between challenging and intuitive, never feeling unfair or overly obtuse. You really feel like you’re solving ancient mysteries alongside Indy.

Combat is simple but effective. It captures the feel of Indy as a reluctant fighter — punches, the iconic bullwhip, and scarce ammo create an experience that’s more about resourcefulness than brute force. It’s a nice change from the high-octane combat of many modern games, grounding the action in character.

The environments are richly detailed and immersive, from jungle ruins to cramped caverns, all of which showcase excellent level design. The atmospheric effects, lighting, and soundscapes build tension and excitement, perfectly fitting the adventurous tone.

Stealth sections are passable, not groundbreaking. While you can sneak past enemies or set up ambushes, these segments feel basic and could have benefited from more depth and polish.

Though the game stumbles in early pacing, it finds its rhythm and delivers memorable moments. The voice acting is solid, adding personality and life to the characters.

### Conclusion

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle successfully reimagines the adventurer’s tale from a fresh first-person perspective. Its engaging puzzles, atmospheric environments, and distinctive combat style make it a rewarding adventure for fans of the franchise and action games alike, despite some rough edges in stealth and pacing.
