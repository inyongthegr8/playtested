Fireball Wizard's retro-inspired pixelated graphics capture the essence of classic arcade games. The art style is charming and meticulously designed, reminiscent of the 8-bit and 16-bit era. The environments are visually distinct, featuring dark castles, gloomy forests, and treacherous caves. The enemy designs are varied, differing in mannerisms, attack patterns, and visual design, showcasing imaginative creatures and challenging bosses that provide both visual appeal and gameplay diversity.

At its core, Fireball Wizard is an action-packed platformer with shoot'em up elements. Controlling a wizard armed with fireball attacks and elemental spells, players navigate through a series of handcrafted and nostalgia-inducing levels, battling enemies, overcoming environmental obstacles, and uncovering secrets.

The controls are very simple: players can move left and right, shoot fireballs, jump, and cast spells. Despite the player controlling wizards equipped with wands and shooting fireballs, Fireball Wizard actually feels like a shoot'em up game, with the fireballs shooting in a straight line and as fast as the player can press the buttons. The difficulty level is high, demanding players' coordination, reflexes, and strategic thinking.

Throughout the adventure, players will encounter four worlds and over 40 levels filled with enemies, obstacles, and secrets waiting to be discovered. Each world culminates in a challenging boss fight with its own unique mechanics and patterns, providing intense and strategic encounters that can definitely pose a challenge. The challenging old-school gameplay will push your skills to the limit as you jump, shoot fireballs, and navigate treacherous platforms. In addition to the main levels, Fireball Wizard also includes side game modes such as a Flappy Bird copy or a time attack mode spanning all levels and allowing only one life.

The game is available for PC at around $6 at the time of writing, and the first 10 levels are free to play on Android and iOS, with an in-app purchase of $5 to unlock the full game.
