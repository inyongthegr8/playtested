Developed and published by Ubisoft, Rainbow Six: Extraction brings together the tactical prowess and intensity of Rainbow Six Siege with a thrilling PvE (Player vs. Environment) experience, heavily inspired by the successful limited-time game mode, Outbreak, in Rainbow Six Siege, Extraction expands upon that cooperative gameplay experience.

Extraction introduces a refreshing change to the traditional Rainbow Six formula by emphasizing tactical teamwork and coordination against a common enemy: the enigmatic alien threat known as the Archaeans. Players form a team of three operators — characters taken from Rainbow Six: Siege, each possessing unique gadgets and abilities that can complement one another. The synergy among teammates becomes crucial as you embark on more difficult missions ranging from gathering intel and hunting down elite enemies, to planting bombs and saving trapped operators in various infected zones. The level design is well-crafted, featuring intricate maps with multiple entry points, destructible environment, and environmental hazards that further challenge players.

The combat encounters are intense, especially when facing the diverse horde of alien threats – all while under pressure in doing the varying objectives. The ability to weaken or eliminate these threats by targeting their nests adds a layer of strategy, as you must decide when to go for the objective, when to extract, and when to thin out the enemy's numbers.

I was actually going in with low expectations for the game, considering the mixed receptions it received when it originally launched back in 2022. However, with the game's recent release on Steam and a 75% off discount across all platforms, I was surprised at how fun it is. Rainbow Six: Extraction is not going to receive any further content or updates anymore, however, for the content it already has, it's still a fun game to play, especially if the price is right.
