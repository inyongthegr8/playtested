Party Animals is a multiplayer physics-based brawler and party game developed by Recreate Games and published by Source Technology. The game features a variety of anthropomorphic animals with unique looks engaging in chaotic and fun-filled battles.

The game is scheduled to be released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox on September 20, 2023, while a three-part closed beta testing is being conducted leading up to the release: September 1 to 3, September 8 to 10, and September 15 to 19. Unfortunately I was not able to get access to the first closed beta, but of course we can thank TapTap themselves for streaming the closed beta gameplay live during its launch.

The entire gameplay setup is quite similar to physics-based brawler games like Gang Beasts and Gummy Life. You choose your character from a list of amusingly designed characters, which are cute anthropomorphic animals this time, and engage in various brawl-based game modes.

The core of the game is physics-based combat, where players can engage in melee combat with other players. You can punch, toss, jump, kick, and headbutt opponents, all while taking advantage of the physics engine to create chaotic and hilarious battles.

For the art style that the game aims for, the graphics are insanely overdetailed. Party Animals easily stands out in terms of graphics and art style due to its incredible attention to detail, realistic fur rendering, well-executed motion blur, and impressive lighting effects.

From a gameplay standpoint, I can see that it already looks more kinetic and alive than Gang Beasts. The animations are fluid, fast, and look responsive, yet still maintain a chaotic quality, which means chaotic fun. Of course, this game brings something new to the table by introducing usable weapons with actual melee moves and ranged attacks, and by placing more importance on interactiables throughout the maps.

The game also features not just an elimination game mode like its contemporaries, but a host of other game modes as well:

Last Stand:  This is a traditional free-for-all skirmish mode where the goal is to be the last animal standing. Team Score:  A mode that involves teamwork and sports-like gameplay. Players compete by dragging a large object (like an ice puck) around the map and scoring goals against each other. Arcade Mode:  This mode offers a collection of random game modes and rules, providing a wide range of challenges and scenarios.

On the TapTap live stream, one of the highlights are the two teams battling it out while dragging a huge ice puck around the map, scoring goals against each other. Arcade mode is what truly lives up to the game's "Party" in the title and positions it as a contender for the best physics-based brawler title.

Can this cute challenger dethrone the OG, Gang Beasts? It certainly seems poised to do so when it finally releases on September 20, on both Xbox and PC (Steam).
