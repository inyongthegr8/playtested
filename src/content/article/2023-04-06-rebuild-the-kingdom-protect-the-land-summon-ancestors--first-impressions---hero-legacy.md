In Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG, you are a legendary hero who is the son of the former king, destined to rebuild your kingdom and vanish the enemies that threaten the land.

Starting out Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG, I was immediately introduced to the grand exploration / dungeon crawling gameplay set in a hexagonal grid based map, populated by monsters, loot, and resources to conquer. Navigation is easy, just touch what tile to move to and it will immediately interact with it either by gathering the resource or loot, or entering combat with hostile units in that area, if any.

Despite the pretty rudimentary visual design of the world, the map is so immense, at the start, you can already see the huge stretch of the world that will be available for you to explore.

Even in the real-time combat, they’re really doubling down on the tile grid layout. With all the character and enemy units being now square tile portraits just bobbing around throwing projectiles and slash effects to signify ranged and melee attacks. And for all intent and purposes, the whole setup is still somehow visually appealing and absorbing to play in its own way.

The main special ability of the player character is the ability to summon ancestral heroes to use them for battle in what seems like a pokemon or card-game like approach to collecting heroes, complete with a tier system. Similar to the elemental-based enemies, heroes will also align to one or two elements with matching abilities that can be used to your advantage.

Pretty early in the game, the city building aspect is introduced which adds another engaging core gameplay element. Players can seamlessly travel between the  “exploration” world map and the city building aspect. Resources looted from the world map  — that are replenished every few real world days —  are used to build structures and these structures can upgrade certain aspects of your hero, like melee and ranged damage.

There is a questing system in place and players can either follow the two main quests for the exploration and city building, and also take on side-quests and daily quests that will give off more additional loot and resources, adding both narrative and gameplay stimulation to the player and the character.

The overall experience of my initial playthrough of Hero Legacy: Adventure RPG was only mildly enjoyable. As much as I wanted to play more, I have experienced various sluggish performances that hindered my ability to enjoy the deeper parts of the game. Regardless, I plan to continue playing this game for a while, and I do hope they fix these issues.
