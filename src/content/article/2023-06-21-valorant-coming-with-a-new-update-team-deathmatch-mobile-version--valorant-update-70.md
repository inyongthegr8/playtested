Valorant is coming with a new update (Patch 7.0) this June 27, which introduces the highly requested Team Deathmatch mode along with three exclusive maps made specifically for the game mode: Piazza, District, and Kasbah. In terms of aesthetics, Piazza bears a resemblance to Ascent with its European architecture, District resembles Split with its urban Japanese setting, and Kasbah shares similarities with Bind with its African location.

Unlike the standard free-for-all Deathmatch where players compete to reach 40 kills or achieve the most kills within a 9-minute timeframe, Team Deathmatch in Valorant puts players in 5v5 team matches. The objective is for a team to reach 100 kills or have the highest kill count after 9 and a half minutes to emerge as the winners. Additionally, players can now use their abilities and pick up orbs that grant either ability cooldown reduction or health recovery.

There is no in-game economy, and players can choose their loadout of weapons at the start of the match or after respawning. As the match progresses, more weapons become available to equip.

Of course, not every agent will be equally balanced in this game mode, especially those that focus more on utility rather than killing. It is not yet known if these abilities will be tweaked specifically for team deathmatch, or if a ranked variant will be introduced in the future. However, for now, it appears that the team deathmatch mode will resemble other game modes such as traditional Deathmatch, Spike Rush, and Swift Play, which are primarily designed for fun and casual gameplay.

As for the mobile version, it has been two years since the confirmation that Valorant would be coming to mobile, and it has been a year since a closed beta test was conducted in the China region. However, as of now, there still hasn't been any concrete news about its official release. Currently, the main focus is on the PC version of the game, as well as bringing the shooter into PC Gamepass and introducing new updates such as the Team Deathmatch game mode.

Valorant remains one of the most popular PC game titles in the world, boasting approximately 20 million monthly players and consistently ranking in the top 10 most-watched games on Twitch. Even three years after its initial release, it continues to attract a wide variety of players, including both casual and competitive gamers.
