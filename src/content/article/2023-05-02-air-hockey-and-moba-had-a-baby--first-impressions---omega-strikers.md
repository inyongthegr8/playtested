Imagine if Air Hockey was instead played in human size with six players having their own superhuman powers with absolutely no physical restraints or rules, Omega Strikers is exactly just that and more. It is a 3v3 free-to-play multiplayer game that is available for Mobile, PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Switch, with complete crossplay functionality. For the purpose of this article, I will be talking about the Mobile version with predominantly touchscreen controls.

Omega Strikers starts you off by letting you select what position to play. Goalie, Forward, or a Any Role (called Flex in-game). A goalie’s jobto protect the goal while Forwards either focus on the combat or striking the “Core” to score a goal. They’re just labels though, with no real difference gameplay wise.

Then the game lets you select your character, with their own ability lineup. Then the perks you will need, depending on your playstyle. As for the actual gameplay, the game involves two 3 player teams trying to push the “Core” around and eventually into the opposite goal, while trying to battle with other players and inflict damage to stun, or even take them out of the game for some time.

The battles are ultimately super fun, with the constant back and forth of the Core and the different abilities that the characters use: from the simple dash kick and energy blasts, to the more complex skills that for example spawns walls to block enemies. Overall, the controls are well-built and a lot responsive considering the fast-paced nature of the sport.

The two main modes to play in Omega Strikers are Quick Play and Competitive. Quick Play is just a short pick up game where the first team to score 5 wins. While competitive is a much more complex game mode with character bans and multiple ‘race to 3’ sets to win the whole match.

Overall, there’s not much complexity to Omega Strikers aside from playing 3v3 matches and mastering the skills and abilities of characters, as well as the actual sport itself. But does that not mean that the game lacks depth nor is not fun. In fact, it's probably one of the best cross-play sports games right now.
