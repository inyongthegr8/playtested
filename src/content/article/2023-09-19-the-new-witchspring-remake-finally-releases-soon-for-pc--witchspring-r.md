WitchSpring R is a story-driven RPG that combines elements of simulation, collecting, crafting, and turn-based RPG combat. It serves as a full-on remake of the original WitchSpring 1, initially released for mobile devices in 2015. The game is set to be released on PC on September 26, with plans for Xbox and PlayStation releases in the future, and potential releases on Switch and mobile platforms.

The remake will be available on Steam for a one-time purchase of $34.99, with a 15% discount during the first week of release, and features no in-game microtransactions or premium currencies. A demo was previously available to try during Steam's last Next Fest, and we have youtuber SIN:P to thank for allowing me to share this sweet footage from the demo!

In WitchSpring R, Players take on the role of Pieberry, a cute little witch with unique characteristics, and accompany her on her adventures. Choices made by players influence Pieberry's growth and the game's ending.

Overall, WitchSpring R appears to be a remake that will do justice to the original, and is set to offer a rich and engaging experience for both newcomers and fans of the series with its blend of storytelling, character development, and turn-based combat elements.
