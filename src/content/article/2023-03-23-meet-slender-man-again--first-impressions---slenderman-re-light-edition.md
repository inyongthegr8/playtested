The premise of Slenderman RE: Light Edition is that our main character, the Dave Grohl-looking dude named Edward, is sort of a ghost-hunter. He stumbles upon an abandoned building in the woods and comes across a supernatural experience. With his trusty flashlight, he has to find a way out.

The gameplay of Slenderman RE: Light Edition is about on par with the story. It’s very elementary and it’s almost like some young aspiring developer made it as a school demo or project.

Players just move and look around in first person view and interact with objects by looking at them and touching the interact button. There is another button to toggle the flashlight, and that’s just it. No sprinting and stamina mechanics, battery, nor hard time limit like the original game from more than 10 years ago.

Slenderman RE: Light Edition features two game modes, the story, and the mini-games. The story follows Edward in his experience in that abandoned building, while the mini-games follow a classic Slender Man experience, where players are placed in a map of your choice (out of four) and they’d have to collect all the objects in order to win.

The story is a mediocre experience with almost non-existent adventure game mechanics aside from basically moving around. The interactables like doors, pages, radios, etc are just there to exist and don't provide any valuable gameplay element to the system. The experience feels like a cheap haunted amusement ride where the sensation of being startled and scared is what matters the most over freedom and substance.

And it does scare the player, with its creepy surroundings and incessant abuse of screechy and chilling sound effects. However, there is no real danger to the player from a gameplay perspective. Most of the game is just walking around the environment trying to progress.

There’s not much else to talk about in this game, other than that I was not impressed. Slenderman RE: Light Edition is a game that is supposed to be simple and lightweight, but that doesn't mean the gameplay should be sacrificed.
