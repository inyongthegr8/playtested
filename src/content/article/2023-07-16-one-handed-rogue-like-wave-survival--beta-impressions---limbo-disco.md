game: Limbo Disco

Limbo Disco follows in the footsteps of similar titles Vampire Survivors and Brotato, with its addicting allure entirely playable with one-handed.

Players start by selecting a character from a flavorful roster, each with their own unique personality, attack types, and upgradable stats that are upgradable as you progress throughout the game and collect more materials. The attack types are closely tied to the character and their weapon. Additionally, players have the option to bring in up to four supporting characters, essentially forming their weapon pool.

The levels vary in size and present additional obstacles and hazards as extra challenges, dying enemies may explode, the map can block or damage you in ways that will possibly make it frustrating, it gets increasingly hard on the way to the boss, and the game overall definitely feels more challenging than Vampire Survivors or Brotato. From time to time, you are given chances to heal and recuperate. You can also leave your game and continue it for later, which is a nice quality of life feature even if it has roguelike elements

Limbo Disco is planned to be a free-to-play game, as such, it also has many of the usual F2P elements rolled into this game, like an energy system to keep playing, optional ads to continue playing or get additional resource boosts, and gacha mechanics to unlock new characters or perhaps upgrade them to a higher tier. It also has familiar features like login bonuses, tasks and challenges.
