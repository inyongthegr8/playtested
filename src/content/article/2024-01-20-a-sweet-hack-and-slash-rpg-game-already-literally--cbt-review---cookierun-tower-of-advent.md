‚ú®Overview

CookieRun: Tower of Adventures is a hack-and-slash top-down RPG that adds an action packed entry to the popular CookieRun series and is the first-ever 3D game in the franchise. The game combines elements of platforming and ARPG gameplay, but with similar progression systems and mechanics.

The game is currently on a closed beta testing phase that runs from Jan 20 to Feb 4, 2024 and it only features selected game modes and characters for testers to try. Release date is planned for this year.

üìñStory and Premise

The story follows GingerBrave and his friends who encounters the Sugar Star, who tells the legend of a hero with a shining heart of a brave cookie. With guidance from the Sugar Star, he embarks on a delightful adventure through the Pancake Tower aboard a cute train, tackling challenges, gaining allies, and discovering the prophecy of the shining heart of a brave cookie.

üé®Visuals and Art

Maintaining the vibrant and colorful CookieRun aesthetic, Tower of Adventures features the delightful art style, but now in 3D. The characters, including enemies, are all charming and visually appealing. The game features a lighthearted tone throughout the whole experience, with a whimsical soundtrack playing even during intense combat scenarios.

üéÆGameplay

Cookie Run: Tower of Adventures features a hack-and-slash APRG experience reminiscent of the Diablo games. Unlike other CookieRun games, players actively control their cookies through various levels and challenges within the Pancake Tower. Navigate through obstacles, performing simple platforming sections, and defeating enemies ‚Äî regular mobs and bosses alike.

Each level presents collectibles like coins and hidden chests, with specific goals and challenges with a star rating to enhance replayability. The player can switch between two selected cookies on the fly, each having a unique moveset and abilities. The active control includes managing the dash, normal attack, special attack, and ultimate abilities for the cookie characters.

‚öîÔ∏èCombat and Characters

Combat is more involved, emphasizing timing and skill as players strategically dodge obstacles and time their attacks. It‚Äôs very simple and straightforward hack and slash system. The special abilities for each other are varied and have different mechanics. Some will require precise aim, some requires charging up, and some are straight up activated and deal massive AOE damage.

The game features both melee and ranged characters and there is definitely a cookie suited to whatever playstyle you prefer. The acquisition of the different characters are done via the gacha system.

üìúGame Modes

In Story mode, the characters embark on a quest to overcome challenges, solve mysteries, and prevent some impending threat to the CookieRun world. These challenges may be tied to the unique gimmicks and themes of each chapter within the tower.

Certain levels feature wave modes where players face a continuous stream of enemies in multiple waves. The challenge intensifies as players progress through each wave and there may be some gimmicks like falling floors or gusts of air put within the levels to spice up the challenge.

Players can go solo, or also team up with up to three other players to participate in raids. Raids involve facing powerful bosses and provide an opportunity to earn special rewards. Apart from the main set of story missions, players can engage in specific challenges designed to help them farm different kinds of materials essential for character progression.

‚è´Progression

The game features an energy/stamina system consumed when taking on missions, designed to limit play, although it‚Äôs not really a problem in the early stages of the game and during this beta. The gacha system is another key element of CookieRun: Tower of Adventures, primarily allowing players to acquire new and duplicate cookies. The leveling up process involves using materials and duplicates obtained through gameplay or purchased with in-game currency. Equipping cookies with weapons, gear, artefacts, along with enhancing these items is part of the overall progression.

üíµMonetization

While the monetization model as always, is not final in this preview, the game includes typical elements found in gacha games, such as in-app purchases, cosmetics, booster packs, tickets for gacha rolls, and energy. I do hope the game will be free-to-play friendly when it releases.

üìäTechnical Performance

The game's technical performance is commendable, running smoothly my Snapdragon 888 device. The mobile-oriented UI is clean and easy to navigate. The simplicity of the visuals and UI design ensures that the systems are easy to grasps. Overall, the navigation feels a little bit slow with its animations, however its still an excellent experience for players.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

CookieRun: Tower of Adventures builds upon the beloved CookieRun series but offers a fresh gameplay experience with its transition to a 3D hack-and-slash gameplay for this iteration. The gameplay is indeed engaging with its mix of combat, platforming, and exploration elements, and features varied characters and mission types to keep the experience from becoming monotonous. My experience is already quite solid in this CBT and it is definitely ready for release later this year.
