Persona 5 Tactica is a strategic 'tactics RPG' spin-off developed by Atlus and P-Studio, released on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. Set during the events of Persona 5, the Phantom Thieves find themselves in the 'Kingdoms', facing an armed group called Legionnaires.

The game introduces a grid-based combat system with Chibi-style characters, departing from the traditional turn-based battles and anime-inspired art style. Persona 5 Tactica maintains the series' high production values, offering engaging tactical gameplay, nuanced storytelling, sleek presentation, and a fresh take on the Persona universe.

Persona 5 Tactica's combat system distinguishes itself with a blend of turn-based strategy and environmental manipulation. The grid-based layout and the incorporation of One More mechanic from Persona 5 introduce a unique and satisfying twist to battles. Displacing enemies from cover, leveraging persona abilities to inflict status effects, and orchestrating chain and triple threat attacks form the core of the combat strategy.

Honestly, the gameplay here is probably my preferred option for general turn-based combat goodness, as it introduces unit positions and the environment to the equation. I feel that if both Atlus and its fans are open enough to the idea, it’s probably the next logical step in Persona’s evolution. It could really be a potential system to use for Persona 6. It’s still turn-based, but you get more layers of strategy to it without feeling being overcomplicated.

There isn't any slice-of-life elements here, but it gets a pass because it is a spin-off, and there's really no room to include one, considering that the whole story is basically a big side quest set inside Persona 5's main story.
