HITMAN World of Assassination is a stealth-action sandbox game that puts us in the shoes of the genetically engineered clone named Agent 47, a highly skilled assassin working for an organization called the International Contract Agency. The whole premise is centered around Agent 47 taking different contracts across the globe, setting the stage for the different multinational sandbox levels that acts as our murder playground.

The sandbox setup for the levels is Hitman’s trademark gameplay style, where you are free to experiment and do your own style of assassinations. You are just given the target(s) and placed in an open world sandbox map with varying degrees of openness and map design. For example, the first level is a very crowded palace hosting a fashion show, while the next level on the other hand is a public destination set in Europe with different buildings and establishments that you can enter.

You can either go loud or silent with your approach, In stealth you can use disguises, distractions, or just pure sneaking prowess; in killing, where you can use a high caliber sniper from a far, stage an accident using the environment, or just simply poison your target. The options the game gives you are almost infinite in possibilities.

The entire gameplay setup is entertaining enough on its own, just like the classic Hitman games. But it doesn’t just end there, as HITMAN World of Assassination features a deep progression system that is filled with different types of gear and gadgets to unlock just by playing the game; Trying to achieve decent ranking at the end of each level , or completing the different unique challenges, like trying to kill the target with a specific weapon. You might even spend hours and hours replaying the same mission trying to experiment all while mastering the layout.

Aside from the creative gameplay or the addicting progression system, there is also the overarching story of Agent 47 that divides the levels into three campaigns.

Before, there were three games in the recent Hitman trilogy. Now, these three games have been merged into one game named HITMAN World of Assassination. The base game of Hitman 3 has been converted to that title, with the two previous games included already as playable levels, free for Hitman 3 owners.

It's a great deal, especially for those who haven’t gotten around to playing the whole trilogy, or have started it at 1 and have not been able to continue playing the sequels. That means 21 sandbox levels are available for you to play along with 3 campaigns and a couple of side and bonus missions. If you buy the deluxe pack, you even get more missions.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
