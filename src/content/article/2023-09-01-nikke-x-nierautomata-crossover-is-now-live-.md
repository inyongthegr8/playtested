Both Goddess of Victory: Nikke (or Nikke for short) and Nier: Automata have not been short of collaboration events with other franchises, such as Chainsaw Man with Nikke, or Nier: Automata with even more ridiculous crossovers like Rainbow Six: Siege, PUBG, and Fall Guys. However, both games might have found a match made in heaven with what might be the most sensical crossover yet, featuring very similar themes: sexy girls fighting aliens and robots."

The latest collaboration between Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Nier: Automata is now live! Both Goddess of Victory: Nikke (or Nikke for short) and Nier: Automata have not been short of collaboration events with other franchises, such as Chainsaw Man with Nikke, or Nier: Automata with even more ridiculous crossovers like Rainbow Six: Siege, PUBG, and Fall Guys. However, both games might have found a match made in heaven with what might be the most sensical crossover yet, featuring very similar themes: sexy girls fighting aliens and robots.

The newly announced collaboration, launched on September 1, 2023, with a second part launching next week September 8, brings the leading ladies of Nier: Automata - 2B and A2 plus Pascal - into the harsh world of Nikke. Players will have the opportunity to take control of these iconic androids, and yes, things are getting a little cheeky.

The crossover also includes the Grand Collaboration Event, called OuteR:Automata with a two-part story mode, hacking mini-game, and special operations for more rewards! The whole event, including most of the game modes are expected to run from September 1, 2023 to September 28, 2023

Special costumes are also included for 2B and A2, for example the aptly named Metamorphic Damage, pays homage to a memorable moment in Nier: Automata. In the original game, when characters self-destructed as a combat tactic, their gothic lolita skirts were blown away, revealing a more utilitarian, skin-tight spandex outfit underneath.

The two wildly different but somehow still close enough gaming universes are colliding in what promises to be an epic fusion of melee and gun toting sci-fi action, and a touch of hotness.

Whether you're a fan of Goddess of Victory: Nikke for its hot action-packed gameplay or you've been captivated by the emotional and gameplay depth of Nier: Automata, this crossover promises to offer something unique and memorable for Nikke.
