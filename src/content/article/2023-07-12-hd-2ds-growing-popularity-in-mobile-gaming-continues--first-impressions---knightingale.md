Knightingale revolves around forming a party of five combatants from the player's available heroes, progressing through the story, and encountering formidable opponents. The game offers a degree of openness, enabling players to explore towns, interact with NPCs, engage in trading, and partake in side activities like bulletin board or dungeon crawling.

Knightingale possesses the same allure as other JRPG games, boasting a beautiful soundtrack, turn-based combat, narrative-focused gameplay, Japanese voice acting, and an anime-inspired art style.

The characters can either do a normal attack move or a special attack move with the use of SP which are generated after every turn and persist on subsequent encounters. When encountering powerful monsters and bosses, more powerful abilities called Soul attacks are also possible once the party’s soul meter is charged.  Depending on the weapons or items equipped, characters can also change stances which will change their normal and special moves. As such, weapons effectively determine the character’s moveset, with up to two equipped at a time

Overall, this game seems to offer an enjoyable experience with interesting strategic possibilities stemming from its weapon-ability system. Additionally, it takes advantage of the HD-2D graphics popularized by Octopath Traveler, adding a visually appealing element that gives it an edge over many contemporaries. It's still in closed beta testing for now with a focus on refining the gameplay and story, with plans to add in-app purchase along the way.
