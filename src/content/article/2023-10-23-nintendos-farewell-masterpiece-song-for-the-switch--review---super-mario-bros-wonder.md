‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 10/10

üìñStory

The story of Wonder serves as a delightful backdrop for the game‚Äôs sidescrolling adventures. Bowser's taken an unusual turn by turning himself into a giant evil castle, and it's up to Mario and his friends to set things right. The premise might sound bizarre, but that's where the charm of this game truly shines. It's not about complex narratives but rather a platform for unbridled creativity.

üé®Graphics and Art Style

The game's art style is wonderfully beautiful; colorful and joyful looking, intricately animated with a strong attention to detail. While adhering to the 2D platformer tradition, Wonder adds a dash of surrealism to the mix. The level design is a visual masterpiece, with environments that can transform into something utterly unexpected thanks to the Wonder Seeds, resulting in dynamic art styles that's both nostalgic and refreshingly new. The dialogues aren't fully voice-acted, but for the voiced lines, the acting is wonderfully done, even with the inclusion of new voice actors, especially for Mario.

üéÆGameplay

The gameplay of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is nothing short of a delightful odyssey. At its core, it adheres to the classic Mario formula ‚Äì running from left to right, jumping over pits, smashing bricks, stomping on Goombas, and collecting those precious coins. Players can play as any of the eight characters aside from Mario: Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toad, Toadette, Nabbit and Yoshi.

What sets "Wonder" apart and lives up to its name is its introduction of Wonder Seeds, the whimsical game-changers that redefine the Mario experience. With these seeds, you can never quite predict what's coming next. They invite players to experiment, adapt, and, most importantly, have fun.

The game's innovation lies in embracing chaos. When you encounter a Wonder Seed, the world transforms into a canvas of surprise and wonder. One moment, you're swimming through water; the next, you're evading falling pipes or being chased by bubbles to float you upwards in the air. At first I thought Mario‚Äôs fixation on mushrooms have gotten into him and it‚Äôs finally a gameplay element, but it‚Äôs actually the Wonder Seed‚Äôs doing. The unpredictability and variety introduced by these seeds keep players engaged and curious, like kids exploring a toy store. It‚Äôs really like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.

While the game introduces these dynamic changes, it doesn't lose its fundamentals. You still have those satisfying ‚Äì perhaps frustrating ‚Äî moments of precision platforming and timely jumps. It's a balancing act between the classic Mario mechanics and the refreshing infusion of Wonder Seeds, making it accessible for all types of players.

üïπAccessibility

Of course, it‚Äôs probably the most accessible Mario to date, as it welcomes players of all skill levels, ensuring that no one feels left behind. For starters, there is no time limit. Players have the freedom to tailor their experience to their liking. If you're new to Mario or just want a more relaxed playthrough, you can choose characters like Yoshi and Nabbit, who essentially serve as an easy mode because he does not die from damage at the expense of not having to use power-ups, but he does die from falling into hazards, so it‚Äôs not a full-on invulnerability mode. These characters can also jump farther, providing a comfortable experience. When me and my partner played the game, and had some difficulties in the harder levels, we chose to play Yoshi and it was immediately a more fun experience.

üé≤Multiplayer

Super Mario Bros. Wonder features local multiplayer support for up to four players, allowing friends and family to join in the platforming fun. The lives mechanic is changed a bit compared to solo play, allowing players to revive their friends one last chance before dying. Additionally, the game introduces characters that players can ride on alongside each other, further promoting collaboration and shared exploration. The game is made easier by playing multiplayer, but this aspect basically doubles, triples, and quadruples the fun for me. Whether you're cooperating or competing, the multiplayer mode enhances the overall experience, making it a fantastic choice for group gaming sessions.

üå∑Level Design

Super Mario Bros. Wonder takes players on a delightful journey through the Flower Kingdom, offering a total of six distinct worlds to explore, each with its unique charm and challenges: Pipe-Rock Plateau, Fluff-Puff Peaks, Shining Falls, Sunbaked Desert, Fungi Mines, and Deep Magma Bog. It‚Äôs weirdly named yes, but still self-explanatory as far as describing the general aesthetic of these worlds. There is also The Petal Isles that play a vital role in connecting the six main worlds, although you'll need to complete several stages within it before unlocking the next world.

Each world and the stage in them is a meticulously crafted work of art, blending aesthetics with playability, while adhering to the 2D platformer Mario we all recognize and love. These stages are more than just challenges; they're experiences.  The levels are diverse and filled with imaginative design elements.

The game's multi-layered approach to levels adds depth to the exploration. You're not just moving left and right; you're also venturing into the background, discovering hidden secrets, and unlocking new possibilities. Enemies behave in surprising ways, adding an extra layer of challenge. It's a marriage of creativity and player engagement. In one encounter, I kicked a turtle towards an enemy, only for that enemy to kick back that turtle to me and surprise me. In another, I saw Wonder Seed locked behind bricks that I can‚Äôt destroy, only to find out that you had to lure a type of enemy towards it (instead of killing it) to be able to destroy it and gain access to it.

In the overworld, the levels's star ratings for difficulty provide transparency, helping you gauge what to expect in each level. It's an approach that ensures players can find the right balance between challenge and enjoyment.

‚è´Progression, Power-Ups, and Abilities

Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduces a delightful array of new power-ups. These include the ability to transform into an elephant to break through obstacles, creating bubbles that capture enemies while serving as temporary platforms, and the unique Wonder Flower that triggers unpredictable effects like pipes coming to life or entire hordes of enemies spawning.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder also introduces badges, a system that grants special abilities which are different from power-ups. You can unlock and equip badges as you progress, granting everything from gliding and wall jumps to playful abilities like a Piranha Plant grappling hook. These badges are a dynamic way to customize your gameplay based on your preferences or the specific challenges of a level.

The game's ability to skip challenging levels without getting stuck is a welcome feature, making it less frustrating for those who might face difficulty spikes. This versatility in progression keeps the game inclusive and enjoyable for a wide range of players.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a delightful, whimsical, and mind-bending experience that pushes the boundaries of what a 2D platformer can be, both for you and your friends. In a gaming world filled with endless quests and artificial rewards, Wonder stands out for offering a different kind of satisfaction ‚Äì the joy of playing itself. It's likely Nintendo's swan song for the Switch, and they're certainly leaving with a masterpiece of a bang, before the potential launch of their new console next year.
