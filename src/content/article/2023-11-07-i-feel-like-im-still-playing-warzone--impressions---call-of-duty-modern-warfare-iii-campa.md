Call of Duty campaigns have consistently been celebrated as exceptional single-player experiences, distinct and detached from the intense multiplayer gameplay for which the franchise is also renowned for. These campaigns offer players a gripping narrative, often set in diverse and immersive environments, replete with cinematic moments and heart-pounding action. They serve as an excellent showcase of the franchise's dedication to delivering compelling storytelling, character development, and thrilling set pieces.

Well, with this year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III , it's unfortunate to see that the campaign has not lived up to the high standards set by its predecessors.

The story opens strong with Operation 627, a stealth mission into a gulag, reminiscent of the iconic Captain Price rescue mission from the original Modern Warfare 2. It sets the stage for that familiar traditional Call of Duty campaign experience, but then afterwards immediately sidetracks us to semi open world Warzone-esque missions that never reaches the same level of excitement as traditional Call of Duty missions.

These Warzone-esque missions are called "Open Combat" missions, which aims to allow players more freedom to complete objectives, including looting around containers and manning vehicles. While this is a novel integration of Warzone’s mechanics into the campaign, it disrupts the game's pacing, leading to a disjointed narrative that struggles to maintain cinematic tension.

What's worse than Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's lack of a campaign? It’s Modern Warfare III’s campaign that has truly lost the soul and depth of the franchise. Sledgehammer Games dropped the ball on this one, likely because MWIII was released just one year after MWII, breaking from the usual three-year development cycle, which didn’t leave a lot of time for development.
