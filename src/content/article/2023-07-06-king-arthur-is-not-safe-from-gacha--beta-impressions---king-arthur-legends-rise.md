King Arthur: Legends Rise is an upcoming turn-based squad RPG coming to Android, iOS and PC, with options for cross-play and cross-progression. An Open Beta Test is now available only for Android which will last until the official launch date. According to the iOS app store page, the placeholder expected release date is December 5, 2023, however take this info with a grain of salt.

The game features highly detailed graphics rival those of AAA games, showcasing the medieval era with meticulous attention to detail. The gritty art style perfectly captures the atmosphere of the time, immersing players in a world filled with medieval castles, lush landscapes, and infused with fictional mythical creatures.

The core gameplay of King Arthur: Legends Rise lies in its turn-based squad battles. Players must assemble a party of knights, mages, rogues, and other legendary heroes, each with their unique skills and abilities. Some skills are used defensively, some are AOE, some are for single targets. The battles are challenging but rewarding, with epic boss fights and encounters with mythical monsters that will test your strategic prowess.

King Arthur: Legends Rise features a hero collection aspect, driven by the gacha system known as "Lake Avalon." Players have the opportunity to summon heroes of different rarities, ranging from Common to Legendary. Each mythological hero comes with their own backstory, skills, and abilities, providing a diverse roster for players to experiment with.  To further enhance your heroes' power, the game offers a range of equipment, relics, and upgrades. Collect powerful medieval weapons and equip your heroes with gear via an itemization system similar to ARPG games like Diablo.

As a gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency. Ofcourse, not everything here is final but I do hope the free to play experience at launch will be as forgiving as it is now.
