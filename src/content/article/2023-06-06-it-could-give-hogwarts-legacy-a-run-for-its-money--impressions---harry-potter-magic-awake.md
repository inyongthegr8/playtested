Harry Potter: Magic Awakened re-introduces us to the world of wizarding once again, following a similar path to the one Harry Potter took, with Hagrid guiding us and leading us through Diagon Alley for school supplies. It allows us to customize our appearance and attire, introduces us to the deck-based combat system, and lets us choose owls as companions, among many other features.

The initial gameplay format offers a third-person exploration experience, faithfully recreating the wizarding world in an artistic and stylized format. While the visuals may not be as realistic or awe-inspiring as the AAA title Hogwarts Legacy, they still capture the essence and feeling of the Harry Potter universe. Players can freely roam around a simplified version of Hogwarts, explore the castle premises, visit their dormitory, and even enjoy the thrill of riding broomsticks and flying around Hogwarts. However, for those solely interested in the deck-building aspect, there is an option to fast travel and completely skip the third-person free roam gameplay.

While the game features third-person gameplay, the main combat element revolves around a deck-based combat system utilizing cards called Charms. This system differs from traditional approaches as it incorporates movement cards, allowing players to navigate the 3D battle arena. It isn't purely turn-based or tactical in nature. At the start of battle, a random deck of cards is drawn, and additional cards are drawn as the battle progresses. Players can use these cards by dragging them from the deck and applying them to the arena. They can be used on the ground for area-of-effect effects or directly on enemies. The resulting battles are visually satisfying and tactically engaging, providing a well rounded experience.

As a live service game, Harry Potter: Magic Awakened includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, cosmetics, and premium currency â€” all seamlessly integrated to the Hogwarts experience and feels just like part of it. For instance, the daily login bonuses are designed to make players feel like they are attending Hogwarts on a daily basis, adding to the immersion. The PvP game mode is presented as a dueling club, allowing players to engage in competitive battles with other players. These features contribute to the game's immersive engagement and provide players with a sense of progression within the magical world of Hogwarts and not just another mobile game.
