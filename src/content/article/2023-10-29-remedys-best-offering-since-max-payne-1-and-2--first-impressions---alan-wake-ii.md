Alan Wake II is a thrilling continuation of Remedy Entertainment's captivating narrative-driven games. The game features Remedy's signature storytelling prowess and delivers a survival-horror game experience impressive next-gen level of graphics and innovative gameplay features.

In terms of gameplay, it is much closer to the original Alan Wake than Remedy’s recent explosive and physics-based destructive games like Quantum Break and Control. It plays like a modern third person survival horror game, such as Resident Evil 2 or 3, but with more psychological thriller vibes that will mess with your head, senses, and terrify you without much physical effort.

The game offers a slow-burning, suspenseful experience. It took me some time to encounter action sequences, but these moments of intensity are masterfully crafted. The game weaves a complex narrative that combines elements of horror, psychological thriller, and supernatural mystery.

At first, you'll play as Saga Anderson, an FBI agent investigating a series of murders in Bright Falls. Eventually, you'll be able to play as Alan Wake. Further in the game’s narrative, players can take on the role of either Alan Wake or Saga Anderson, and their stories are interconnected, providing different perspectives on the unfolding mystery.

One of the game's most innovative features is the ability to play chapters in any order, giving players a sense of freedom and replayability. This choice adds a new layer to the experience and allows for diverse narrative exploration.

As a big fan of Remedy from their early Max Payne years to the most recent and excellent Control. Alan Wake 2 might be Remedy's best offering yet since the original Max Payne in terms of technical, storytelling, and gameplay prowess.
