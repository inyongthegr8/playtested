Pre-register

‚ú®Overview
Metal Mind is a pixel rogue-lite stick shooter where players take on the role of a mech that can change its parts and gear on the fly. The game was originally released on PC (Steam) last year for an upfront cost of $18, but I had the privilege of trying out a pre-release build of the Android version, and I must say, it transitions quite seamlessly to the mobile platform, if not even better suited for it.


**Pros:**


+Charmingly simple retro art-style
+Plethora of unlockable guns and robot appendages
+Experimentation and freedom to swap out robot parts
+Enemies are varied enough to necessitate the use of different weapons
+Auto-aim mechanic, making it a ‚Äúsingle-stick‚Äù shooter


**Cons:**


-The persistent upgrades feel somewhat underwhelming
-Minor bugs and some crashes (still a pre-release version)

üìùNotable points:
‚ú®Will probably be a free-to-play title with ads
‚ú®Release date not yet announced

üé®Visuals
Metal Mind's art style is charmingly simple with its retro pixel design, and the soundtrack complements the action nicely. However, one area where it could use improvement is localization. Despite setting the game to English, a significant portion of the text remains in Chinese, which can be confusing, especially when trying to understand game mechanics.

üéÆGameplay
The gameplay mechanics in Metal Mind follow a classic twin-stick shooter formula, but with a twist. It‚Äôs actually a ‚Äúsingle-stick‚Äù shooter because aiming is already done automatically. You just have to fire the weapon, or activate abilities. Character movement is controlled using the left stick, and shooting, dodging, and ability with the right part of the screen. Because of the auto-aim mechanic, the controls feel really responsive and right at home as a casual mobile rogue-lite experience. Of course, this comes at a strategic cost of not being able to manually aim at enemies.

ü¶ø Everything fits in this Robot
The game mechanics are actually decent for a rogue-lite, encouraging experimentation and freedom to swap out parts. As you progress through the game's ever-changing map and clear room after room, the player is presented with upgrade pickups that can change the mech‚Äôs actual body part. Swap your mech parts out for different bonuses and purposes, or if perhaps you simply just like the looks.

The weapons also come into play and feature a variety of projectile styles and even melee weapons like laser swords. The game allows you to equip two weapons at the same time and switch between them during combat, although I found the switching process is somewhat slow. Some weapons are extra powerful but shoot very slowly, some shoot very long lasers that bounce on walls, some have rapid fire but deal damage in small amounts. I find every weapon viable, it just depends on the enemy types which are also varied enough to necessitate the use of these different weapons. There is a cooldown/overheat mechanic in most weapons, and each of them behaves very differently. In this game, you can't simply continuously press the fire button without caution.

Persistent progression in Metal Mind isn't just about luck; it's about skill and strategy. Accumulate points to enhance your skill tree after each run, making minor but crucial adjustments to stats such as damage, attack speed, armor, and movement. They‚Äôre really really minor, only single digit percentages of increase, but crucial nonetheless. I would have liked more substantial amounts of upgrades though. You also have the option to purchase some weapons to start runs with, providing a head start on your adventure.

üíµIs it free-to-play or paid like the PC version?
While Metal Mind is a paid experience on Steam, it sure looks like it will adopt a free-to-play model on mobile, but don‚Äôt quote me on that, this is just my speculation. because I‚Äôm seeing ads whenever I die, and there's even the option to watch more ads to boost your progression and acquire additional skill points. This choice may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a common approach in mobile gaming.

The core gameplay loop in Metal Mind is undeniably enjoyable and addictive. With a plethora of unlockable guns, quirky robot appendages, customizable load-outs, skill synergies, secrets, challenging enemies, and charismatic characters, the game offers a wealth of content to keep players engaged. However, it's worth noting that there are some minor bugs, although nothing that breaks the overall experience.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
Metal Mind is a charming mobile rogue-lite that shines in its robot-building aspect and diverse gameplay possibilities. It's a fun and engaging experience with the potential to become even better with further improvements. When it finally releases and it turns out that it‚Äôs really free-to-play, then there‚Äôs no more question that this game is worth your try.
