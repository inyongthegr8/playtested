LOTR Heroes of Middle Earth combines hero collection and turn-based combat mechanics to create a familiar gaming experience. The game follows various campaigns inspired by the LOTR storyline, giving players somewhat in charge of their journey and battles. The main campaign, known as the Light campaign, begins with Frodo's adventure alongside Strider (Aragorn). However, as players progress and collect more heroes, they have the freedom to customize their lineup, even replacing Frodo and Strider themselves.

In the early stages of the game, players are generously rewarded with resources and energy through various introductory quests, objectives, and challenges. These rewards enable players to unlock up to four characters quickly. Additional resources can be earned by playing the game, particularly EXP, which determines the maximum level of characters.

The progression system is designed to be intuitive and beginner-friendly, guiding players on which gear or resources to acquire for upgrades. Although unlocking characters may require some grinding, the game offers a degree of control over character progression, reducing reliance on randomization.

The gameplay in LOTR Heroes of Middle Earth revolves around two main components: turn-based combat and the RPG hero collecting aspect. Progression through the chapters entails engaging in turn-based battles, each contributing to the completion of the storyline. The game offers hundreds of engaging challenges for players to conquer.

These missions are rated based on a three-star system, evaluating the player's performance and is repeatable. Apart from the Light Campaign, there is also a Shadow campaign featuring different sets of "Shadow" Heroes to collect, providing an entirely separate storyline that players can progress in side by side with the Light campaign.

The turn-based combat is your standard combat system, with each of the characters having access to various unique skills such as AOE attacks, heals, buffs or debuffs. These skills can be upgraded along with the character. The overall combat is not really that deep, without any unique mechanics or items to use. Fortunately, players who aren’t interested can speed these battles up to x3 and use the auto function to allow the AI to take control.

The hero collecting aspect of the game allows players to summon various heroes to their aid, unlocking them as they meet specific requirements. Players can enhance their characters' stats by equipping them with gear obtained through looting or crafting. This upgrade system is user-friendly, guiding players on the necessary steps — what gear or resource to acquire and where — to improve their characters. Characters can also synergize with each other depending on their relationships in the story, such as with Frodo and the other Hobbits for example.

LOTR Heroes of Middle Earth appears to be an engaging mobile game for fans of the Lord of the Rings universe. The combination of turn-based combat, hero collection, and the familiar storyline allows Lord of the Rings fans to experience the epic adventures of Middle-earth in a mobile game format.
