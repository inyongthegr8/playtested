Getting Over It+ is a physics-based platformer that will require your patience, dexterity, and problem solving skills… well mostly, your patience.


**Pros:**


+Highly addictive — up until you reach your limits to try again another day

+Challenging platformer puzzles

+With high difficulty comes a highly rewarding experience


**Cons:**


-Game is highly punishing and frustrating, clearly not for everyone

-Frustrating control system by design

The original Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy was released back in 2017 and has now been recently released as Getting Over It+, as part of the Apple Arcade subscription.

The game, developed by Bennett Foddy, is a spiritual successor to his earlier games, "QWOP" and “GIRP”, which are flash-based games in the early 2010s you might have probably heard of,  and features a similar level of difficulty and frustration.

The premise of Getting Over It+ is simple: you control a man stuck in a cauldron who must climb a mountain using only a large hammer to propel himself. The controls are straightforward, but the gameplay is anything but. You move the hammer by swiping around the touchscreen, and you can use it to swing, push, or pull yourself up the mountain full of random objects that don't make any sense.

In fact, nothing makes any sense in Getting Over It+ aside from the ultimate goal of climbing up. There are no story elements, no cutscenes, or even any progression or combat system. It’s just purely a physics-based platformer that will test your patience and skills to its absolute limits.

The game is designed to be extremely challenging, and it is not for the faint of heart. The mountain is full of intentionally frustrating obstacles, such as steep cliffs, narrow ledges, and blockades, which require precise movements and timing to navigate. One misstep can send you tumbling back down to the bottom, and there are no checkpoints or save points to help you out, resetting your progress back to where you fell into --- which can by a LOT.

The controls are simple on paper and only require either hand, but very hard and highly fallible when it comes to actually climbing the mountain. You just move the hammer around your character in a 360 degree circle of varying degrees of reach, hitting the ground or any obstacle to push yourself against it; or you can cling or hook the hammer around higher elements to swing your character around.

Getting Over It+ is probably the harder version compared to the PC release, as the transition to touch screen controls makes the game significantly harder to control due to the lack of precise input method like the mouse. There are some in-game options to help you like sensitivity and the acceleration, but it still doesn’t match the level of control that you get with a mouse pointer. However, with time and enough practice, the game is still highly playable and not impossible to control.

The difficulty of the game is what makes it so addictive — up until you reach your limits to try again another day. There is a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that comes with overcoming a particularly challenging section of the mountain. You will find yourself constantly pushing to reach the top, no matter how many times you fall. Especially if you start to master its physics-based mechanics.

While Getting Over It+ is highly frustrating, the game is filled with witty commentary and humorous quips from the narrator, who is voiced by Bennett Foddy himself. His dry, sardonic tone is a welcome reprieve to the otherwise extremely punishing gameplay, and it helps to alleviate some of the frustration that comes with constantly falling. The narrator even encourages you to stop playing and try again next time, recites various motivational quotes to you, and even plays relaxing music on top of the already relaxing background lounge music to help you manage your irritation.

As narrated by Bennett Foddy, the game’s mountain-climbing gameplay serves as a metaphor for life’s challenges and the struggles we all face. The game’s protagonist, a man trapped in a cauldron, serves as a symbol for the obstacles we must overcome in our own lives, and the mountain itself represents the journey we all take towards self-improvement and personal growth. It suddenly becomes a very deep game, with thought-provoking effects that can affect the player long after they’re done playing with it.

The mountain you must climb is treacherous, with obstacles that seem almost impossible to surmount. Every time you just beat a difficult challenge, another one will test your skills even further and it’s a testament to the game’s design that it never feels unfair, because it definitely feels doable and within reach.

While the game is simply in 2D view and the premise of a man stuck in a cauldron with superstrength to even use a hammer to move himself is definitely nonsensical, the game’s physics engine is incredibly well-designed with realistic physics that make each maneuver feel weighty and realistic, It clings to the mountain, its rocks, and objects alike very satisfyingly well.

Conclusion:

Getting Over It+ is a game that is not for everyone due to its highly frustrating and punishing difficulty, but is highly recommended for players who enjoy difficult games and are looking for a new challenge. If you’re also looking for a game to challenge your friends with and to ultimately mess around with, then this is something you and your friends can consider playing.
