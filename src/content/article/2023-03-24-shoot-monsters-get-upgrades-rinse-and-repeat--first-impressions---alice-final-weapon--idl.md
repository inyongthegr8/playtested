Alice, Final Weapon : Idle RPG , or ALICE is an idle monster killing RPG game with typical anime-style visuals and cel-shaded graphics, where players infinitely kill monsters in a never-ending cycle. There is no in-game story, and the whole focus is the non-stop gameplay.

The gameplay loop consists of the player character clearing increasingly difficult stages, gathering enough currency and materials to upgrade their character and acquire more powerful weapons, to be able to clear higher stages. Kill monsters, get upgrades, experiment with builds, kill bigger monsters, rinse and repeat.

There are many underlying mechanics in ALICE, from the itemization, level progression, boss fights, to the side missions that result in a game that constantly engages the player and keeps him tinkering with the character despite the passive idle nature. There is no active combat gameplay, but it still involves a lot of character building and tinkering. Nevertheless, while ALICE is an AFK game in its core, but there is still an option to partly manually control the character’s movements

The weapons, skills, and armors are letter tiered and are usually acquired by a “loot summoning” technique which requires diamonds. Players can either keep playing the game and do quests and missions; or watch ads and spend some cash to accumulate diamonds to have more chances at loot drops. Fair play for the developers for not locking Diamonds behind a paywall, but it is still hard to acquire once the initial tutorial quest ends and you reach the higher levels.

Loot is randomized, but the chances of getting better loot increases with every loot summon, providing assurance that players will eventually get top tier loot regardless of their luck, instead of purely relying on unforgiving RNG drop rates.

The AFK/Idling aspect is well implemented, even offering a low power mode where the screen turns off but the game still runs in the background. It does require periodic online connectivity to work, however.

Playing Alice, Final Weapon : Idle RPG, I was immediately engaged by its progression system and the fun climb upward through the monster filled stages. However, I easily reached its soft paywall and any substantial progression got slower and slower from then on. Thankfully, the game is not as tainted as other free-to-play games and the in-app purchases are only encouraged at worst, and optional at best, not forced down your throat.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
