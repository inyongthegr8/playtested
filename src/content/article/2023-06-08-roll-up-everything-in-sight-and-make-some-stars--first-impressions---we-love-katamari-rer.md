We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie is an enhanced edition of the classic PS2 from 2005 that takes players on a whimsical and quirky adventure as they step into the shoes of the Prince once again, as well as the King of All Cosmos during his boyhood.

The graphics have been overhauled for modern systems, but still retains that simple low poly aesthetic â€” it is still the charming and vibrant Katamari world that fans know. From the colorful landscapes to the quirky characters, every aspect of the game is even more visually captivating than before.

We Love Katamari REROLL+ is an absolute piece of insanity and absurdity. From the moment you start rolling that sticky ball, you're catapulted into a world where logic takes a backseat and chaos literally reigns supreme. The game throws you into a whirlwind of bizarre scenarios, outrageous characters, and mind-bending environments that defy any sense of normalcy.

In We Love Katamari REROLL+, the simple act of rolling a sticky ball, called a Katamari, takes center stage, creating a strangely addictive and mesmerizing gameplay loop. With its charming visuals, catchy and as equally as weird soundtrack, and an array of creative levels, We Love Katamari is a true gem in the world of video games that finally had its well deserved remaster.

Starting from humble beginnings, players are tasked with rolling up small objects, trash objects or room clutter, gradually progressing to collect larger items such as cats, bicycles, and even buildings. The mechanics are simple and easy to grasp, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.

We Love Katamari REROLL+ features a wide range of imaginative and whimsical levels. From a bustling cityscape to a tranquil countryside, each level is filled with unique challenges and surprises. The game features a fantastic blend of environments, ranging from ordinary household settings to extraordinary fantasy realms. It's always satisfying to progress the transformation of a small Katamari into a colossal ball rolling through vibrant and colorful landscapes
