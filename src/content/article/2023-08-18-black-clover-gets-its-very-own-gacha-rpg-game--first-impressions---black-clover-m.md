Drawing inspiration from the beloved anime and manga series, Black Clover M presents players with a high-quality adaptation that seamlessly integrates iconic scenes into the gameplay. The exceptional quality of animation brings the Manga and Anime into life, creating a visually striking experience. With cel-shaded graphics characteristic of anime adaptations, the game does justice to the visual aesthetics of the anime.

At its core, Black Clover M offers a traditional anime-based gacha RPG game. As you advance through the game, you'll have the opportunity to acquire potent gacha characters, enhance their abilities, and engage in an array of activities including single player story missions, repeatable farming missions, and asynchronous arena PvP battles.

The game features an overworld exploration segment in which a chibi version of Asta can traverse the game world. This is intermixed with a third-person exploration mode when visiting significant locations like villages and castles, although with only a fixed camera angle and not much to do except go to the next objective.

The narrative leading up to the scenes remains faithfully recreated from the anime, albeit in a more condensed form. It seamlessly integrates battle sequences with the game's turn-based combat mechanics. Additionally, the game introduces certain creative liberties to allow for non-canon flexible character selection.

The free-to-play aspect is very much viable, at least during the initial hours of gameplay that I have experienced, although an energy system does introduce limitations. The game does slowly ease players into the limitation by providing bonus energies for new players, ensuring that early gameplay remains relatively unaffected.

However, a very alarming concern with Black Clover M is the requirement for players to grant access to their contacts, photos and videos, as well as storage. Such access seems unnecessary for this game anyway and could potentially lead to data misuse or breaches.
