üí§What is Zenless Zone Zero?
Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ for short) transports players to a post-apocalyptic futuristic metropolis known as New Eridu. In this ravaged world, humanity faces the relentless onslaught of otherworldly beings known as the Ethereal, who emerge from enigmatic portals called Hollows. These formidable creatures have wreaked havoc, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. However, a resilient group of survivors has formed New Eridu, a bastion against the Ethereal threat. Their survival hinges on extracting technology and resources from their enigmatic foes. ZZZ is expected for release on PC and mobile, but that‚Äôs not all, as the game was also announced for consoles during the on-going Tokyo Game Show this year.

ZZZ was recently showcased during this year's Tokyo Game Show alongside other HoYoverse games, with its own 20-minute segment. Judging from the live chat on the Youtube stream, oh boy, fans are clearly extra hyped about their favorite titles, both upcoming and ongoing!

üè¨The Last Bastion of Humanity
New Eridu stands as a beacon of hope, offering hospitality, openness, and freedom to disaster refugees, the displaced, and survivors from other settlements. The city thrives with a diverse population, shaped by both the wonders of Ether technology and the remnants of the old civilization. But in this ideal urban paradise, danger lurks in the shadows, from menacing gangs to the treacherous Hollow Raiders and conspirators.

üßüThe Danger
The Hollows themselves are catastrophic phenomena, bizarre spherical dimensions that emerge suddenly, devouring everything in their path. Inside these Hollows, the fabric of space-time becomes chaotic, mutating people and spawning dangerous mutant creatures known as the Ethereal. Well, aside from these monsters, we also have the aforementioned thugs and criminals as threats.

üéÆGameplay
Zenless Zone Zero offers a visually pleasing gameplay experience that combines urban exploration with high-stakes combat. Players step into the shoes of a Proxy, a character tasked with aiding others in their exploration of the perilous Hollows that will serve as dungeons. As you progress, you'll assemble a team of diverse stylish characters, each with their own unique and flashy colorful abilities. Teamwork is key as you strategically combine these abilities to unleash devastating damage and intricate combos on your Ethereal adversaries.

üé®Visually Stunning
The gameplay is touted as action-packed and visually stunning, and watching the gameplay videos, I have to strongly agree. From the fluid animations to seamless menu transitions and eye-catching colorful visual effects, ZZZ sets a high bar for aesthetics. I was particularly impressed by the attention to detail in the art style and color palettes. However fluid it looks though, the responsiveness of controls remains a key aspect to look out for in the actual gaming experience. If it‚Äôs anything close to what we‚Äôve seen in HoYoverse games, it‚Äôs bound to be good.

Beyond the adrenaline-pumping battles, players will also have the opportunity to explore New Eridu itself. Engage in a variety of side activities, such as arcade games or eating at restaurants, to further immerse yourself in this somewhat vibrant, post-apocalyptic world.

üì∫Tokyo Game Show 2023
During the show, the voice actresses of two main characters, Yuka Iguchi (Japanese voice actress of Koleda) and Yumi Igarashi (Japanese actress cast of Corin), made special appearances. They shared insights into some of the characters in ZZZ's story. Additionally, they shed light on New Eridu, the last urban civilization in the game.

üéÆConsole release! (Alongside PC and Mobile)
Perhaps the biggest announcement of the segment (albeit towards the end of the showcase) was the confirmation of a console release for Zenless Zone Zero. While the exact console and release date wasn't specified, given miHoYo's track record, it's highly likely that it will make its way to PS5.

With Genshin Impact already on PS5 and Honkai: Star Rail set to arrive in October, PlayStation players are in for a treat. A Switch version though? Also very likely and probably going even further and probably releasing on the upcoming Switch successor, that last part was just my speculation from me though.

Zenless Zone Zero is poised to be another HoYoverse hit as an urban fantasy action RPG. With its promise of a rich narrative, immersive world-building, and engaging gameplay, it's a title that is worth looking out for, especially that it‚Äôs now coming for a lot of platforms.
