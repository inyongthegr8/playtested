I used to play a lot of Dynasty Warriors and Romance: of the Three Kingdoms on my PS2 backthen in my childhood days, so it’s a delight to see that the franchise is still alive and kicking. Now, we are getting a full-on Dynasty Warriors experience on mobile with Dynasty Warriors M, and it features console-level of visuals and gameplay! it is even on par with Dynasty Warriors 9.

Dynasty Warriors M combines action and strategy, capturing the essence of the Dynasty Warriors series. The core gameplay centers on large scale hack-and-slash combat on expansive, open battlefields. Players command their chosen officers to engage in epic battles against hordes of enemies and rival officers, using combos and special attacks to dominate the field.

Combat is undoubtedly a highlight of Dynasty Warriors M and the series as a whole. The game provides an immensely satisfying experience as players face off against hundreds of on-screen soldiers and officers. Each officer boasts unique weapons and abilities, and players must skillfully execute combos and special attacks to handle massive groups of foes. The battles are visually striking, with an abundance of on-screen action, featuring intricate animations and detailed character models.

In addition to the gacha character progression, the game incorporates a kingdom building aspect. Players must upgrade their castles and city infrastructure, gather resources, and manage real-time upgrades.
