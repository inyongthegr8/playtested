Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is an upcoming free to play mobile game entry in the Devil May Cry franchise. This spin-off was announced a few years ago, with a Chinese release a few years back, and has since been released globally for a beta test just recently this July. The official launch is still unknown, but according to the iOS app store page, the placeholder expected release date is December 2, 2023, however take this information with a grain of salt.

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is kind of in a no man’s land when it comes to the narrative, similar to “DMC”, it is instead set in its own continuity, but treads a familiar ground for fans by being a retelling of DMC 3 plus other elements taken from all over the mainline games, even those set after DMC 3.

The core gameplay mechanics of Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat stay true to the franchise's roots, offering fast-paced, combo-driven combat. Players are treated to the familiar hack-and-slash style the series is known for, engaging in thrilling battles against hordes of demonic foes. At the same time, it adds its own twist via a popular mobile game mechanic, which is the seamless characters switching. Players are allowed to seamlessly switch between Dante, Vergil, and Lady to perform synergistic combos on top of their own movesets. Recently, a fourth playable character — Nero  has been added as an option.

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat has all the hallmarks of what makes DMC great, but in mobile form: The combat system, the beloved characters, and a linear story mode campaign. Infused with its gameplay is a live service element and gacha system that is incorporated into the progression system.
