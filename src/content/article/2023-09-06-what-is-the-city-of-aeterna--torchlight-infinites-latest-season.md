Torchlight Infinite is the latest installment in the beloved Torchlight ARPG franchise, offering fast-paced battles and cross progression across platforms. Players explore a fantasy world, collect endless loot, and customize heroes with unique skills and legendary gear. In addition, it features fine graphics and smooth performance, making it one of the better ARPG options on mobile today.

As a live service game, Torchlight Infinite has received numerous updates and seasonal content throughout the past year since its release, and the latest upcoming season: The City of Aeterna is set to bring new exciting content and balance changes to the game.

Simply put, The City of Aeterna, dubbed as “The Lost City”, is a new and significant gameplay addition in Torchlight Infinite, introduced as part of the game's "The City of Aeterna" season. Players can access the city by collecting enough "Mark of the Ruins" fragments and overlaying them on the Aeterna Map.

Within The City of Aeterna, players can defeat monsters to gain Energy. Collecting a certain amount of Energy rewards Kindling which grants seasonal rewards when offered to the Sacrificial Bonfire. As players progress the Bonfires, they have the opportunity to challenge the boss of The City of Aeterna: The Lone King of Aeterna, varying levels of difficulty. The more Bonfires collected, the better the rewards from defeating the boss.

Additionally, there is a First Kill event in place for The Lone King of Aeterna and the top ten players in each server (AS, EU, NA) and for each Hero Trait will receive 500 Primocrysts. Additionally, these top ten players will receive an exclusive event Avatar. Those who complete the challenge but don't reach the top ten rankings will still earn a smaller reward of 100 Primocrysts, which is still a nice bonus for participating in an otherwise fun upcoming Season.

Some of the other contents and features included in Torchlight Infinite's "The City of Aeterna," which goes live on September 7, 2023 includes a Redesigned Crafting System, and Forsaken: Iris, a new hero with unique abilities related to the Spirit Magus, plus the extreme Flame of Pleasure trait for Frostfire: Gemma.
