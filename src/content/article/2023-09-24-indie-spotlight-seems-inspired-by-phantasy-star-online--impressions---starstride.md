Starstride is an online Action RPG that blends the unlikely combination of high fantasy with sci-fi, and it works out quite well. Two allied factions, Neoterrans and Wokens, are at war against a mysterious alien civilization. Your character is one of the few powerful fighters remaining after a mysterious defeat at the hands of the enemy's leader.

It might appear daunting and unusual at first, but this uniqueness is what makes it a refreshing addition to storytelling premises and world-building. Thinking about it, the whole premise, even the character designs seems heavily inspired by the Phantasy Star Online series of games.

Starting out, players must choose between these two factions, and they are born into and fight for it. You have the freedom to create your own character (up to five on the same account), customize them, and level them up.

After choosing the faction, players create characters of either gender with customizable appearances. Additionally, players select their character identity, which determines their class. As a solo player, I preferred the assault role over defense or support roles. Apart from the role, players can also choose from a variety of weapons, shaping their combat style and moves. I was only able to play solo, but there is an option for creating a party with other players to raid rifts together.

While the combat feels satisfying already and the animations are all flashy and impressive, the game is still very buggy and incomplete. Also, in this early version that I've tried, only the first hour's worth of the main campaign is accessible. These issues are understandable given the early stage of game development. At the end of the day, this game really holds a lot of promise, and Starstride could easily become a hit if it gets a lot more polish, since the concept is already good.
