Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is an upcoming free to play mobile game entry in the Devil May Cry franchise, filled with the same hack and slash gameplay style the series is known for, of course, sprinkled in with mobile game mechanics such as gacha system and live service elements.


**Pros:**


+Stays true to its hack and slash roots

+Streamlined controls for mobile

+Seamless character switching added to its combo system


**Cons:**


-Fans of DMC may not appreciate the switch to the grindy gacha gaming formula

-No Automatic Mode or Idle Mechanics

The spin-off was announced a few years ago, with a Chinese release a few years back, and has since been released globally for a beta test this July. Release date is still unknown, but according to the iOS app store page, the placeholder expected release date is December 2, 2023, however take this information with a grain of salt.

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is kind of in a no man’s land when it comes to the narrative, similar to “DMC”, it is instead set in its own continuity, but treads a familiar ground for fans by being a retelling of DMC 3 plus other elements taken from all over the mainline games, even those set after DMC 3. The game features three mainline characters that were also featured in DMC 3; Dante, Vergil, and Lady, now teaming up with each other with seamless character switching and integrated combos during combat.

The visuals are nothing amazing by today's standards, but it definitely looks better than DMC 3 and lands in the same ballpark as DMC 4, which is decent for mobile game standards. The atmosphere and feel of the series is mostly retained, including the soundtrack and effects. The character models are succinctly detailed, and the environments are well-designed, successfully capturing the atmospheric essence of the series. While playing on a smaller screen, the visuals are able to maintain an enhanced level of fidelity.

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat features full voice acting for many of the pre-rendered cutscenes, with different voice actors for our iconic characters such as Dante. The performances are mostly done right, and I have no complaints whatsoever. However, many of the in-game cutscenes are silent and lack dialogue, despite the game seeming like it will include it based on how the dialogues are presented.

The core gameplay mechanics of Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat stay true to the franchise's roots, offering fast-paced, combo-driven combat. Players are treated to the familiar hack-and-slash style the series is known for, engaging in thrilling battles against hordes of demonic foes. At the same time, it adds its own twist via a popular mobile game mechanic, which is the seamless characters switching. Players are allowed to seamlessly switch between Dante, Vergil, and Lady to perform synergistic combos on top of their own movesets. Recently, a fourth playable character — Nero  has been added as an option.

The controls are responsive, enabling precise movement, powerful attacks, and stylish combos. You can dash, launch into the air, perform quick or powerful attacks, as well as one ability and ultimate ability. While the attack system is simplified for mobile — including Dante’s moveset which now incorporates both sword fighting and gunslinging into one moveset. it retains enough variety to create enjoyable and visually impressive combos, especially when the seamless character switching feature is used to combine characters.

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat has all the hallmarks of what makes DMC great, but in mobile form: The combat system, the beloved characters, and a linear story mode campaign. Infused with its gameplay is a live service element and gacha system that is incorporated into the progression system.

In order to progress through the campaign, you need to level up your overall rank, which means gathering EXPs from completing open-ended missions, which will also give materials to upgrade weapons, characters, and stats. You can also try rolling for new character cosmetics, weapon skins, and more powerful rare legendary movesets via the gacha system, either by spending money or religiously playing the game.

The inclusion of a gacha system, while a popular mechanic in mobile games, may polarize fans especially those coming from the mainline series. While it adds a layer of excitement and collectibility, the game's reliance on grinding and the need to spend real money to unlock desired items can be a turnoff for some players.

In an ironic twist of events, on the mobile platform known for its idle game mechanics, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat doesn't have an Automatic Mode that was featured in the mainline series to make it accessible for more people. It's a shame because the gacha and farming-oriented progression system would have benefitted from idle mechanics.

Conclusion:

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat successfully translates the core elements of the Devil May Cry franchise into a mobile gaming experience. The high-octane combat, seamless character switching, and visually appealing graphics all contribute to an engaging adventure. However, the incorporation of mobile game mechanics like gacha systems may deter some fans. Nevertheless, the game manages to capture the essence of Devil May Cry and provides an enjoyable hack-and-slash experience on the go… as long as you have an internet connection.
