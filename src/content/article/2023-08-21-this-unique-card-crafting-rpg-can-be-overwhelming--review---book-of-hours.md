BOOK OF HOURS

Book of Hours, a brand new creation by Weather Factory, invites you to embark on a journey that explores the deepest recesses of the occult and the unknown. This intricate game offers a multi-faceted experience that combines investigation, crafting, and introspection to create a truly unique adventure.


**Pros:**


+Atmospheric minimalistic artstyle
+Addictive gameplay once you’ve understood the mechanics
+Unique experience probably unlike anything you’ve experienced before


**Cons:**


-No tutorial
-Very steep and confusing learning curve
-Requires a lot of reading

At first glance, Book of Hours appears as a difficult concept to understand, and it is absolutely true, much like the arcane secrets it promises to unveil. Developed by Weather Factory – the creators of another similar game in Cultist Simulator, Book of Hours captivates with its rich atmosphere and esoteric themes. Released on PC, it beckons players to explore the realms of the occult, inviting them to step into the shoes of an amnesiac librarian rebuilding a destroyed ancient library.

The artstyle might appear deceptively simple — even looking like a Flash game from the early 2000s, yet it's this simplicity that adds to its mystique. The game adopts a minimalist approach with a rich, dark color palette that sets the tone for the eerie and secretive world it encapsulates. Its visuals are reminiscent of vintage hand-drawn illustrations found in ancient grimoires, while also mixing it with a stylized cartoon-esque formula. The soundtrack is relaxing and fitting for the game’s combat-free direction. In the game’s UI you are even given controls to pause, skip to the next track, and go back to the previous track of the current soundtrack that is playing.

Book of Hours has a very unique and unconventional approach to its gameplay mechanics. The game begins around two primary actions: Considering and Talking, both of which play a pivotal role in crafting cards and progressing the narrative. The core gameplay revolves around a card-based mechanic, where each card represents an action, item, or concept within the game's universe, and you must combine them with others to result in an outcome.

There is no voice acting or narration, and everything must be read by the player. The game is heavy on the reading aspect, especially with all the cards and concepts having their own descriptions that are actually important for the gameplay and not just for extra flavor.

Most of the gameplay is centered around that concept, and even actions as mundane as speaking to a character about a topic, paying characters currency, or receiving rewards are all done via these card crafting system. Each of the cards has their own sets of “principles” as the game calls it, that must align with the object or character you are trying to interact with. These principles are actually plentiful and are hard to keep track of, which may result in back-and-forth-ing in the early parts, comparing different cards to determine their compatibility with one another.

Early in the game, the protagonist — devoid of any memories — stumbles upon a village and eventually unlocks access to the central stage of the game: The Hush House. This dilapidated grand library must be painstakingly rebuilt, one room at a time, with the help of the villagers living nearby.

Of course, this endeavor comes at a cost, requiring you to earn various currencies and favors to afford the repair and restoration of the library. The game, along with its actions and crafting, plays out in a real-time pausable manner, complete with a day/night cycle that refreshes the character’s energy, memories, and rerolls new sets of potential visitors and characters to interact with as days pass.

Somewhat of a miracle, but somehow, many of the books inside the library have survived, albeit in dire need of management. Book of Hours embraces its central premise with fervor, allowing players to acquire and investigate occult books, catalog them, gain knowledge, and meet other visitors and scholars along the way. This mechanic serves as a gateway to an intricately woven narrative that rewards careful attention and exploration. As the layers of mystery are peeled back, players find themselves immersed in a world that teems with enigmatic stories, arcane rituals, and a sense of wonder akin to flipping through the pages of a forbidden tome.

The game's mechanics are as multifaceted as the lore it unravels. Crafting inks, memories, and other esoteric tools isn't just a mechanic—it's an integral part of the experience, underscoring the meticulous nature of arcane practices. The study of nine Wisdoms and the conquest of the nine Elements of the Soul not only offer a fascinating challenge but also contribute to the personal growth and transformation of the player's character and the unveiling of the character’s past and origins, based on the player's choice.

Weather Factory's penchant for obscurity and self-discovery is evident in Book of Hours. The game doesn't hold your hand, but rather encourages you to piece together the narrative through experimentation and exploration. This approach adds depth and engagement, making each discovery feel like a personal triumph. However, it's worth noting that the learning curve may be too steep for newcomers, making the experience extremely niche and not for everyone; some quality of life improvements in the UI, and a proper comprehensive beginners tutorial would enhance the experience for all players.

Conclusion:

Book of Hours is a beautiful work of art that is hard to get into and equally hard to let go of. The first time playing it is the hardest challenge with its peculiar mechanics, but once it clicks, it can become a highly addictive, rewarding, and somewhat relaxing experience. Unless you've played its predecessor, Cultist Simulator, it's unlike any game you've ever played before, for better or for worse. Simply put, its uniqueness can be overwhelming. This distinctiveness is both its strength and its challenge.
