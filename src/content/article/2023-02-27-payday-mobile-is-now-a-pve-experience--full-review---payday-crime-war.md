PAYDAY: Crime War is an upcoming Mobile first-person shooter game that allows players to plan and execute high-stakes heists in a cooperative multiplayer setting.


**Pros:**


+Fun PvE heisting experience

+Gun Customization options


**Cons:**


-performance and crashing issues

-unresponsive controls and clunky shooting mechanics

In PAYDAY: Crime War, you are in a squad of bank robbers and you have to perform heists such as robbing banks or jewelry stores to progress throughout the game.

PAYDAY: Crime War might seem like a familiar mobile title, it is because it was actually already launched a few years ago and was discontinued almost immediately back in 2019. It originally was a 4 vs 4 PvP where players are pitted on a cops vs robbers setting, a surprising departure for the game series.

Finally faithful to the OGs

PAYDAY: Crime War has now been updated to focus entirely on PvE cooperative gameplay, similar to the original Payday games like Payday: The Heist. This means that the PvP game mode has been entirely removed, and players can only work together to complete heists and missions against AI civilians, guards, and police.

The updated game features a gameplay formula similar to the PC and console versions, adapted into mobile form. This means that the game is free to play but includes microtransactions, real-life waiting times, gacha, and live service elements. While these features may be a turn-off for some players, they are common and widely accepted as norm in mobile games and may not impact the overall gameplay experience.

Gameplay Analysis

The game features a variety of missions that require players to work together to steal valuable items, rob banks, and fight off law enforcement. You first have to spend money to be able to start Heists, and upon successfully completing it, you earn money and rewards.

Throughout the mission, players must work together to complete a variety of objectives, such as stealing valuables, drilling into Vaults, or hacking into security systems. These objectives are often timed and require players to work quickly and efficiently.

There is a high level of customization that players can achieve. Players can choose from a variety of weapons and equipment, and they can also customize their gear with attachments as they progress through the game. This allows players to tailor their characters to their preferred play style and adds an extra layer of depth to the game.

Still in open beta so thereâ€™s not much players at the moment, so most of my gameplay experience has been entirely with bot companions. They are mostly competent for the most part, helping you in shootouts and properly reviving you when downed.

After completing a heist, players are rewarded with cash and experience points. These rewards can be used to purchase new weapons and equipment, unlock new skills and abilities, and upgrade existing gear.

The gameplay loop of PAYDAY: Crime War involves a mix of strategic planning, fast-paced action, and cooperative teamwork. Players must work together to overcome obstacles and complete objectives while fending off waves of enemies and collecting rewards along the way. This cycle is continued over and over again, leading to more powerful gear and more difficult heists.

Technical Performance

The performance is still being worked out, and it does not perform well currently even on high end devices. I tested this on an iPhone 13, and the game still recommended a low setting option. Even after setting it to a 60fps game mode, the game still struggles to maintain the target 60 FPS and will drop to 30 at times. I also experienced multiple crashes and server issues while trying this game out.

While the controls are customizable and the HUD elements can be repositioned, the overall gunplay feels a bit unresponsive, which is a shame because it comprises majority of the gameplay. The shooting is clunky and moving feels floaty.

Conclusion:

The updated version of PAYDAY: Crime War is now more appealing to fans of the original Payday games who are looking for a cooperative mobile experience. However, players should be aware of the game's microtransactions and live service elements before deciding to download and play.
