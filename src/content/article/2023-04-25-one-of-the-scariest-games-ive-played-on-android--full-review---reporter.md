Reporter - Scary Horror Game
Reporter is a first-person adventure horror game that takes place in an antiquated, abandoned hospital. The game is developed by AGaming+ and is available on Android devices.


**Pros:**


+creepy atmosphere

+actually scary without using many cheap jumpscares

+console-level graphics


**Cons:**


-very short, only an hour of story

-inconsequential story

üìùNotable points:

*Voice-overs are only in Russian language

*One-time purchase only with no IAPs

Reporter follows the story of a journalist who is investigating a mysterious series of macabre events. This investigation has taken him to this old, abandoned hospital. As the player, you take on the role of this journalist and must explore the hospital, solve puzzles, and uncover clues while avoiding monsters to progress through the game. The game features an unsettling atmosphere, mild jump scares, and a variety of Resident Evil 7 inspired puzzler gameplay.

Clear inspirations ‚Äì but this isn‚Äôt just a simple clone.

The game is clearly inspired by both Resident Evil 7 with its puzzle gameplay, as well as the capturing the ambience and atmosphere of the now canceled Silent Hills‚Äô P.T. (playable Teaser). Horror elements aside, the game is actually more reminiscent of classic adventure titles, because most of the gameplay is centered around solving puzzles to progress throughout the chaptered levels.

Gameplay Analysis

I started the game, and immediately, I was thrust into the creepy atmosphere and tone of the game. The gameplay mostly involves roaming around the hospital and using your trusty flashlight to light up the mostly dark interiors. Not even a minute into it, and there was already a mild jump scare of sorts that scared the @$%# out of me. I normally hate jump scares as they feel like a cheap way to scare players and audiences, but this time it felt fitting because of the extremely creepy setting of the game ‚Äî it is only used sparingly.

While it has jumpscares, it doesn‚Äôt need them to be effective

Majority of the scares are from the game being just outright creepy and unnerving. Dark hallways, mannequins, vague distant apparitions at the end of hallways and doorways, some poltergeist stuff going on knocking things off to the ground. I can say that a lot of thought has gone into crafting the tightly packed horrifying experience.

Fairly challenging puzzles made harder by the scariness factor

The puzzle elements are pretty standard, which range from finding hidden objects and manipulating the environment in order to uncover hidden clues, to the usual ‚Äúlive‚Äù puzzles where in this case ‚Äì you need to untangle the wire configuration given a limited amount of moves to solve it. If not for the creepy and panic-inducing setting, it would have been a cake walk in the park, but the horror aspect of the game has made the puzzles more challenging, perhaps even extremely difficult, depending on how easily scared the players are.

Aside from puzzles, you also need to run and hide from monsters, failure to do so will result in death. There is no way to fight back, no weapons, no attacks. Just plain hiding which makes these kinds of games extra scary ‚Äî which reminded me of the game Amnesia.

Console-like visuals

The game's graphics are impressive for a mobile game, with detailed textures and console-like realistic lighting effects that enhance the overall atmosphere of the game that stands out against the rest of other horror games on the mobile platform. The antiquated setting is neatly detailed, with each room and hallway providing a unique sense of dread and unease. The game's sound design is equally impressive, with eerie sound effects and a haunting soundtrack that help to build tension and create panic and a sense of impending danger.

The narrative and total playtime

The story is probably the weakest point of the game, as it follows a rather archetypical journalist‚Äôs mystery investigation gone wrong and doesn‚Äôt really involve the player that much nor provide an interesting driver to move the story or to pique the players‚Äô curiosity. Most of its strengths stems from providing a genuine horror experience for players that is consistent from start to end.

As far as the story goes, Reporter is very, very short, clocking in at around an hour total of gameplay only ‚Äî that is if you‚Äôre brave enough to endure the whole experience and solve the puzzles without much difficulty. The game is only voiced in Russian, but there is an option to display in-game text and subtitles in English or other languages.

Conclusion:

Overall, however, Reporter is an impressive and engaging horror game that will keep players immersed not by the story, but by the atmosphere and scariness factor. The game's console-level graphics and creepy gameplay make it a standout title in the horror genre. As such, for just a dollar without in-app purchases or ads, Reporter is a must play for horror game fans looking for the next terrifying experience for the mobile platform.
