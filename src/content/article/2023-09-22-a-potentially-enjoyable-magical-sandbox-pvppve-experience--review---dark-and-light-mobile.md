Dark and Light Mobile is an open-world survival RPG sandbox game designed for mobile devices. Set in a fantasy world filled with diverse landscapes and magical creatures, players can explore this expansive world, tame magical creatures like Wyverns, Griffins, and Unicorns, and build their own structures and homes. The game also features an RPG crafting system where players can create weapons and armor using resources gathered around the world and by using magic.

Dark and Light Mobile has been adapted from the original PC version and provides basically the same experience but to mobile devices, although with some adjustments to graphics and controls to suit the platform. I first saw this interesting early access game years ago on Steam but never really got around to it. I didn‚Äôt have the chance to play it before. Surprisingly, it has also been ported to mobile devices just recently, and I finally had the opportunity to try the game during its ongoing Beta Test, which will last until October 31, 2023.

üì∫Visuals and Performance
The visuals have been toned down in the transition from PC to mobile version, but it still looks good for a mobile game. I‚Äôve experienced laggy performance for the most part and some crashes ‚Äî even with my Snapdragon 888 device, but it remains playable and impressive nonetheless. This is especially notable considering that they managed to port the entire PC experience into a mobile package without any big sacrifices in gameplay. The game has been fully translated to touch controls with appropriate prompts for actions and menus. That said, this mobile edition is also available for PC as an emulated title, with full support for cross-progression across Android, iOS, and PC.

üéÆGameplay
Dark and Light Mobile provides players with a vast and open world to explore, featuring diverse landscapes and environments, from lush forests to desolate deserts. Players can gather resources from the world, and then craft weapons, gear, items; build houses and bases; and capture variety of magical creatures, which can then become your loyal companions or mounts

üë∂Initial Experience
There is a quest guide system implemented that serves as an excellent introductory guide for beginners. Players can choose to follow it or play at their own pace. My experience has been on both sides; I followed the tutorial but gradually began doing more things on my own as I learned more about the game. At the start, players are placed on a beginner server and eventually allowed to move to a "Peaceful" PvE server. Dark and Light also offers PvPvE servers where player raids and guild wars take place.  After just a few hours, I had already built a cozy house on top of a hill overlooking the starting village, complete with my flying pet that I could ride on.

‚è´Addicting but grindy progression
I find resource gathering and character progression addicting in this game, driven by the desire to unlock new gear, modules, and to power up your character. Players can progress by accumulating XP to level up and unlocking new crafting recipes as they choose to learn new skills through a linear list of technologies and fields. This involves spending research points and resources to further enhance your learning rates. The more resources you invest, the greater the experience gained. Research points do run out and must be replenished either by waiting it out or through in-game currency.

The entire crafting and leveling system is complex, and this complexity intensifies as you level up. The poorly scaled UI with its small buttons further exacerbates the problem. Higher level items and buildings will require higher level resources, and these resources will require certain equipment to synthesize, up to the lowest resource denominator. The game demands time and effort to gather resources and accomplish tasks, so be prepared for some serious grinding when playing this game.

üíªüì≤ Controls, Combat and differences with the PC version
The gameplay is slightly different from the PC version, but it's still very clearly Dark and Light in its core. The gameplay has been optimized for touch controls and is somewhat less action-oriented than its PC counterpart. Combat and gathering are now carried out through touch screen prompts, which lock you into an animation instead of allowing free movement while attacking or interacting. This makes the system feel clunkier and less responsive. At its current state, I don't find the combat segment enjoyable. In terms of environmental interaction, there seems to be an extra step in many actions, particularly when gathering items or using equipment. There is definitely room for improvement in streamlining these processes.

With these feedbacks, it‚Äôs notable to mention that the version that I played is still noticeable a work in progress. Additionally, a small number of texts, dialogues, and tutorial videos remain incomplete or just use computer-generated voices.

üíµMonetization model
I‚Äôm not really certain if this game will be released as a free-to-play game, especially since the original PC version cost money upfront on Steam, but this mobile version certainly looks to do so, judging from how the foundations are in place.

Certain aspects of gameplay and monetization may continue to evolve until the release. However, it's evident that the foundations for premium currencies and cosmetics are already in place. As spending money can directly impact progression rates, this game has the potential to become a pay-to-win scheme, particularly for hardcore PvPvE players.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
Dark and Light Mobile has the potential to provide an enjoyable and immersive survival crafting sandbox experience for both PvP and PvE players. However, its success will depend on how well it addresses the issues and concerns raised during its development and how it balances its monetization methods. Nevertheless, players seeking a mobile sandbox adventure with both solo and multiplayer options can look forward to trying this game once it is released.
