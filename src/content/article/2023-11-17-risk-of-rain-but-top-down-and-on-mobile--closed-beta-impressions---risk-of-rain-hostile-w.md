Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds is the latest addition to the Risk of Rain series alongside the recently released Risk of Rain Returns, it ventures into uncharted territory by bringing the beloved roguelite experience to the mobile platform.

The game retains the chaotic essence of its predecessors while introducing a fresh narrative and innovative gameplay mechanics. As players embark on a space odyssey to rescue the scattered crew of The Shimmer Mark, they navigate treacherous planets, engage in intense combat, and uncover the mysteries that unfold across the cosmos.

The gameplay loop is simple; it's not a roguelite anymore but more of a shooter with steady level progression. Enter a level, kill monsters, loot gold, buy upgrades, and extract. Rinse and repeat for the next level. It still has that roguelite touch, though, as upgrades and looted gold are only temporary for that run, so you're encouraged to spend everything you can during runs.

While the game is also marketed as having four-player co-op, a substantial part of the experience is actually in single-player mode, and multiplayer is unlocked deep further into the game. In Singleplayer, there are multiple planets to conquer, with five levels each divided into small areas. All playable in three difficulty settings. The progression system ties seamlessly into the rescue mission narrative, reinforcing the player's connection to the overarching story even if itâ€™s just a minor narrative element.

Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds adopts the typical mobile game model with free-to-play, microtransactions, hero collecting, and gacha elements. While this aligns with prevalent trends in mobile gaming, it introduces a departure from the traditional Risk of Rain formula that not everyone will like. Some might prefer it to be a premium game with an upfront cost. Having said that, I was satisfied with my solo free-to-play experience so far, I got everything I need to progress through the first few hours of play in this CBT.
