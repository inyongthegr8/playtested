Coromon is a soon to be mobile game that combines elements of classic monster-taming RPGs with its own unique twists, making it appealing to both fans of the genre and those looking for something fresh.

The game initially released on PC and is set to launch on Android and iOS on November 8. There's a free demo with progression carryover to the full version, already available on TapTap now. The full game will be available on Nov 8 for a one-time purchase of $5.

I have only scratched the surface with the Demo version, but the full version of Coromon's world is vast, comprising six major zones and cities interconnected by routes. These maps featuring various biomes and dungeons that come complete with Zelda-like puzzles and hazards. Exploration is a rewarding experience, with hidden loot and things to discover should you venture off the beaten path.

The allows players to collect over 120 charming creatures, known as Coromon. Each Coromon has its own unique attributes, abilities, and elemental alignments, which can be a factor in building your squad. The creatures' designs are creative and varied, making each one feel like a distinct addition to your team, in addition to different potencies and evolution types.

Coromon's combat system features tactical turn-based battles that require careful resource management. Unlike traditional Pokémon battles, where you can spam your most powerful moves, Coromon's battles demand more strategy. Each action consumes stamina, including skills, status effects, and attacks, requiring you to make thoughtful choices to overcome your opponents.

The gameplay of Coromon is not groundbreaking nor innovative, but you don’t always need those qualities when the game understands its purpose and remains enjoyable at the end of the day, for a bargain price of $5 (for the mobile platform).
