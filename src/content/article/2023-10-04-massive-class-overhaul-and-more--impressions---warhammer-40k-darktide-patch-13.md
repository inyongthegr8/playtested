Warhammer 40K: Darktide wasn’t universally praised at launch, mainly due to its optimization and repetitive nature. However, Patch #13 brings about the much-anticipated "Class Overhaul", which brings more engaging content into the game. This update is a game-changer, not just for existing players but also as a first impression for newcomers.

Goodbye Feats, Hello Talent Trees:
The most significant change in Patch #13 is the replacement of the Feats system with Talent Trees. Each character class now has its Talent Tree, and as you level up, you earn Talent Points. You can allocate these points to unlock and enhance abilities and passives within your Talent Tree. This is similar to system seen in RPG games such as Diablo.

Baseline Abilities and Customization:
Every character begins with Baseline Abilities, including Blitz and Aura, which can be modified or upgraded through the Talent Tree system. This means that from the outset, you have a unique character, and as you progress, you can shape them to your liking. This level of customization adds depth and replayability to the game, as you experiment with different builds and strategies. Overall, the flexibility here is incredible and was never possible before, allowing you to actually tailor your character to your preferred playstyle.

Improved Performance
Well, compared to my experience around the launch which was awful, the performance has improved significantly running on my same setup of i7-8700k and RTX 3080. However, there are still minor stutters when looking around or loading new textures. The Xbox Series X version on the other hand offers both 60FPS performance and a 30FPS quality mode. The Series S version is locked to 30FPS only.

Other changes:
Patch #13 also introduces extensive balance changes. Characters and enemies have been adjusted to ensure a more engaging and challenging experience. Weapons have been fine-tuned based on community feedback, enhancing the overall combat feel.

Beyond gameplay changes, Patch #13 addresses hundreds of bugs and even adds new narrative flavors such as new cinematic cutscenes, ensuring a more enjoyable and immersive gameplay and narrative experience. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements, such as the revamped controller options section, make the game more accessible and user-friendly.
