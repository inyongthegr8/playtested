Tower of God: New World is an idle RPG gacha game where players assume the role of a new character inserted into the original narrative, following Bam's footsteps and experiencing the adventure firsthand. The game introduces a new player-named character, along with his navigator and tutorial guide Rin, bridging the gameplay mechanics with the overarching storyline. Through Rin's guidance, players become an integral part of the Tower's world, forging their path, and interacting with iconic characters.

Playable in vertical mode, the gameplay involves team building, choosing the right party members, and utilizing materials to level up character slots, and weapons to progress through the Tower and Story in a dual narrative structure. The game also features a gacha system where players can summon characters from the Tower of God universe, including iconic characters from the original Webtoon.

As an idle game, Tower of God: New World doesn't require players to actively engage in combat, except for optionally choosing when to utilize ultimate skills. The primary focus lies in team building and selecting the appropriate team members depending on the enemy.  A notable feature is the Shinsu Link mechanic with the character slots, replacing traditional character leveling. Players level up Shinsu Links tied to the formation and deployment of their party members.

Tower of God: New World is currently in Early Access, with a release soon to follow on July 26. If you are a big fan of Tower of God and find gacha gaming enjoyable, then it is a no brainer that this is a must-play. For newcomers looking for a high quality gacha game to play, this is also a great starting point to learn more about Tower of God, as it somewhat retells the original story in a summarized manner.
