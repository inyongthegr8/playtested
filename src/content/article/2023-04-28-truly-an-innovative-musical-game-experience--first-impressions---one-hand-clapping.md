Developed by Bad Dream Games and published by HandyGames, One Hand Clapping is a one-of-a-kind 2D puzzle platformer that combines music, platforming, and puzzle-solving in a unique and innovative way that is sure to captivate players, and make them vocally exhausted.

I went in blind with this game, with the only information I knew being that the game requires a microphone to control the characters. I actually thought the game involved clapping to control the characters, but I was surprised to find out that you actually need to sing or hum different tones in all sorts of different ways.

The first part seemed scary and gloomy at first, with pitch black levels and some mild visual jumpscares, but it turns out to be a lighthearted game overall, with melancholic overtones and an adventurous spirit to boot. One Hand Clapping introduces its singing mechanics quite slowly, only initially requiring the player to make some noise, then steadily making the mechanics more complicated by requiring a steady control of your tones, until eventually knowing how to produce tones by instinct.

The game's mechanics rely heavily on the player's ability to use their singing voice to solve puzzles and progress through the game. The player takes on the role of a character who has the power to use their voice to affect the environment, be it to levitate huge stone blocks, bring power to elevators or lamp posts, sculpt the landscape to create a bridge, control flowers, and many more. The character still needs to be controlled via touch input, moving left or right or jumping, but most of the gameplay is focused on the singing element.

The main character must journey through a world filled with musical landscapes and quirky characters for reasons unbeknownst to us. The player encounters many puzzles and environmental obstacles that call for his singing ability to be used, and these puzzles are creatively well done and do vary across the whole journey that feels fresh every time.

This unique gameplay mechanic sets One Hand Clapping apart from other games and creates a truly innovative and immersive experience. I was truly engaged playing the game with a control option other than my hands.
