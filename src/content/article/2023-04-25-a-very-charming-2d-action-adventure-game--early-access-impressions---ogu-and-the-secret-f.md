Ogu and the Secret Forest is an early access title that looks like a top-down classic RPG game, but in reality it is more like an action-adventure game with an emphasis on puzzle elements. In this game you control baby Ogu, who was magically transported into another world without much explanation except that there is a war that is in dire need of a hero. What we know is that Ogu is a highly adventurous daydreamer and one that is not going to back down with the challenge of being a hero.

The game's hand-drawn characters and various types of puzzles provide a cute and immersive atmosphere. The game features different areas to explore, each with its own unique atmosphere and population characters, and players must solve puzzles and find hints to reveal the game's secrets and mysteries.

The combat is very simple, with only one main move to use – which is attack with Ogu’s trusty butterfly net. Ogu can sprint, so the combat is mostly trying to hit enemies one or two times then swiftly running away to avoid their attacks. There’s not much to it except for the various skills that you may unlock (there’s four slots), but I haven’t gotten that far yet to have any usable items.

There are two main difficulties, and the easier one basically makes the Ogu invulnerable. Perfect for those looking for a casual experience, or those looking for the narrative or puzzler elements only.

The inclusion of various gameplay features, such as collecting hats and masks with special skills attached; and meeting, helping, and getting helped by friends, adds a fun and engaging aspect to the Ogu and the Secret Forest. The cliche isekai story of the game works for the most part and it adds an intriguing factor. It is currently in Early Access, so expect more changes and additions this coming year.
