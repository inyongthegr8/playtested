Released as a follow-up to the successful roguelite Heroes of Hammerwatch, Hammerwatch II returns to the franchise's hack and slash roots and directly follows the story and gameplay of the first Hammerwatch game. Players are transported to a fantastical realm where they must aid King Roland's resistance efforts while navigating a world teeming with danger, quests, and opportunities for character growth.

Hammerwatch II features a simplistic classic Zelda-like combat system, where players must master a diverse cast of character classes including the Wizard, Paladin, Rogue, Warlock, and Ranger. The array of available classes offers varying approaches to combat, catering to different playstyles and preferences. Instead of being point and click like Diablo, the character is directly controlled using the WASD and aiming is done via mouse. For its controller scheme, it functions similarly to a twin stick shooter, especially when using ranged classes. Characters in total have one movement ability, one basic attack, one defensive and offensive skill to use, forming the basic core of the combat.

Just like the first game, Hammerwatch II is proud of being designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing players to band together and basically double or quadruple the fun. However, unlike the first game, Hammerwatch II does not feature shared/split-screen.

Hammerwatch II features intense battles as players -- solo or cooperatively -- navigate hordes of enemies, unleash devastating spells, and strategically time attacks to emerge victorious. The mastery progression system for upgrading the skills of the heroes and attribute system further deepens the experience, enabling players to refine their characters' abilities and tailor their skills to suit their unique strategies.
