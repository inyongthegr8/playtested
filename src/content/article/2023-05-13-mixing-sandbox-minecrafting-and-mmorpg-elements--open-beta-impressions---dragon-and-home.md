Pre-register

Dragon and Home is a sandbox-style MMORPG that combines crafting, Minecraft-style blocky graphics, and traditional MMORPG elements to create a fun and lighthearted game. Reminiscent of games like Hytale and Minecraft (but in third person). For the purpose of this article, I played the mobile version open beta.

The game starts off by allowing the player to create their own character and naming it themselves. The premise of the game is reminiscent of a typical Isekai story, where the player wakes up in an outpost as the hero chosen by the Tree of Life to save the world

Immediately from the start, what I noticed about Dragon and Home was its clean smooth graphics. For a game with Minecraft-style blocky graphics, the graphics are actually quite impressive. The lighting is well done, with even motion blur and smooth anti-aliasing baked in, which I suspect is thanks in part to the Unreal Engine powering it.

The gameplay starts off by teaching the player the ropes, including how to gather resources, survive, and craft items like Pickaxes and axes to chop down trees and rocks for resources. The player is also taught how to hunt and combat various animals for food and additional resources. Pretty typical mechanics for a crafting/survival game, but slowly being infused with MMORPG mechanics. The first few hours of gameplay are dedicated to learning the ropes and focusing on crafting and survival, which can be a bit slow and unenergetic. The game lacks action in the early stages, and the new player experience could benefit from more excitement to captivate players.

The game features three classes, which are the typical archer, mage, and warrior classes. The maximum level is only 20, but from what I've learned and experienced about this game so far, this game will be grindy all the way through, with heavy focus on endless crafting and farming.

Dragon and Homeâ€™s crafting elements, Minecraft-style graphics, and MMORPG gameplay creates a lighthearted and kid friendly gaming experience. The game seems to offer a lot of content, with a heavy focus on crafting and farming, and players can expect to sink many hours into the game if they enjoy these types of activities. The graphics and soundtrack are both above expectations, and the game runs smoothly on most mobile devices if I'm judging from its performance on my old android phone.
