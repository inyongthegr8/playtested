It has been a very busy day today with The Game Awards, with well deserved awardees like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Alan Wake 2, thrilling announcements, and exclusive reveals at The Game Awards. There is one particular exciting piece of news has caught my interest among all of them, and it’s Black Myth: Wukong, the highly anticipated action RPG deeply rooted in Chinese mythology.
