title: "Beat your high score in this slasher game | First Impressions - Thunder Samurai Defend Village"
description: "The gameplay of Thunder Samurai Defend Village is simple. Enemies come from both sides, you can either tap on the left to attack left, or tap on the right to attack right. You can activate a special lightning attack when fully charged. No need to move, jump, block, or do some platforming maneuvers. Each enemy dies in a single hit and the game seemingly plays infinitely in a singular level, with high scores being the one and only end goal."

The gameplay of Thunder Samurai Defend Village is simple. Enemies come from both sides, you can either tap on the left to attack left, or tap on the right to attack right. You can activate a special lightning attack when fully charged. No need to move, jump, block, or do some platforming maneuvers. Each enemy dies in a single hit and the game seemingly plays infinitely in a singular level, with high scores being the one and only end goal.

Despite the aforementioned simplicity, Thunder Samurai Defend Village is still a challenging game to play and harder to master. You cannot just spam attacks as there is a small window after it that makes you vulnerable, making precision and timing very important. Hitting it too early can lead to being hit by the enemy. At start, you can only afford to get hit once, the next time is a death sentence.

As you kill more invaders, the frequency and speed of their onslaught increases, reducing the margin of error even more, and almost playing like a rhythm game of sorts. Further into the waves, enemies will even overlap with each other, adding to the confusion. Every few kills or so, it gives you a short break by dividing the enemies into waves, giving players a much needed reprieve from the anxiety-inducing combat.

No matter how fun it is, Thunder Samurai Defend Village gets repetitive easily after a short while, upgrades are few and far between due to the grindy progression and there are also frequent intrusive ads that you are forced to watch every few runs. But if you love beating high scores and playing as samurais more than anything else, then this game might be a blast.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
