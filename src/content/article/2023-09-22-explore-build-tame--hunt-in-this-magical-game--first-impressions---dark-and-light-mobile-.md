Dark and Light Mobile provides players with a vast and open world to explore, featuring diverse landscapes and environments, from lush forests to desolate deserts. Players can gather resources from the world, and then craft weapons, gear, items; build houses and bases; and capture variety of magical creatures, which can then become your loyal companions or mounts

For new players, there is a quest guide system implemented that serves as an excellent introductory guide for beginners. Players can choose to follow it or play at their own pace. My experience has been on both sides; I followed the tutorial but gradually began doing more things on my own as I learned more about the game.

At the start, players are placed on a beginner server and eventually allowed to move to a "Peaceful" PvE server. Dark and Light also offers PvPvE servers where player raids and guild wars take place.  After just a few hours in the Peaceful server, I had already built a cozy house on top of a hill overlooking the starting village, complete with my flying pet that I could ride on.

Dark and Light Mobile has been adapted from the original PC version and provides basically the same experience on mobile devices, although with some adjustments to graphics and controls to suit the platform. I first saw this interesting early access game years ago on Steam but never really got around to it. I didn’t have the chance to play it before. Surprisingly, it has also been ported to mobile devices just recently, and I finally had the opportunity to try the game during its ongoing Beta Test, which will last until October 31, 2023.

So far it’s clearly a game still in development with general clunkiness, crashes, and incomplete content, but I can’t deny that the potential to be a success in the mobile market is high when it finally releases, very much unlike its PC counterpart.
