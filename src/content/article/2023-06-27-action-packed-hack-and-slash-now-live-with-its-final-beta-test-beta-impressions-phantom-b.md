Phantom Blade: Executioners offers a fast-paced experience that requires players to utilize two-button abilities along with dodge/roll, jump, and parry/block actions. The game provides a plethora of unlockable abilities/skills that can be mixed, matched, and synergized to create amazing combos.

The developers have taken a very clever approach to combat combos, ensuring that it doesn't rely heavily on extreme memorization. Instead, players can pre-set up to two combo chains in their character's settings. By executing a preset combo chain, players only need to press the assigned ability button. However, this doesn't mean that the game doesn't require any reflexes at all. There are still plenty of opportunities for movement and agility through the dodge and parry maneuvers available. There are no automated or idle mechanics so the player will have to press every action they want to make in this game.

Phantom Blade: Executioners shares some similarities with souls-like games, featuring a high level of difficulty and a focus on reflexes and timed actions. The game offers four unique characters: Soul, ZuoShang, Mu, and The Chord, representing the Swordsman, Heavy Swordsman, Agile Swordswoman, and Ranged Support Hero classes respectively. Players have the ability to create and play each character separately on a single account.

Phantom Blade: Executioners is gearing up for its highly-anticipated release and is currently hosting a live open beta test from June 26 to July 10, 2023. Join in now to get a taste of the action-packed hack and slash gameplay before the official launch!
