Total War: PHARAOH

Strategy

Total War: PHARAOH is an refreshing addition to the popular Total War series, with a unique blend of historical strategy and grandeur, set in ancient Egypt. Developed by Creative Assembly, this title delves deep into the mystical world of pharaohs and pyramids, delivering a gaming experience that is somewhat both exhilarating and educational‚Ä¶ ableit with creative liberties.

It is a full-on PC game released on Steam with no console or mobile ports for now. However for mobile players looking to try out a game of this caliber, you can pretty much play their older titles like Total War: MEDIEVAL II and ROME: Total War or any modern android device and experience mobile grand strategy at its finest.


**Pros:**


+Stays true to the franchise's core formula, and even back to its historical roots
+New weather effects that affect the battles
+New campaign mechanics
+Impressive detailed visuals
+Smooth performance


**Cons:**


-Poor AI behavior
-Clunky unit combat
-Feels like an expansion instead of a full-on Total War entry

üé®Graphics

The graphics of Total War has evolved a lot throughout the years from tiny low poly units to detailed individual units even on par with third person video game levels of fidelity. Total War: PHARAOH continues that evolution and is nothing short of spectacular. The game transports players to the heart of ancient Egypt, with stunning attention to detail with the architecture and environments. The graphics are more crisp and sharp, and the monotonous sand throughout its setting adds a certain asthetic that makes the game look more smooth and clay-like. However, the game brings a refreshing twist to the table with novel mechanics, enriching the experience for historical Total War fans.

üéÆGameplay

Total War: PHARAOH stays true to the franchise's core formula, which combines turn-based grand strategy and real-time battles. Players step into the role of an Egyptian ruler, overseeing the grandeur of an ancient civilization as they vie to become the Pharaoh. The game offers a refreshing change of pace from the recent Fantastical settings of Total War, and returns back to its historical roots as it immerses players in the complexities of managing an Egyptian dynasty.

In contrast to Total War: Troy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, or Total War: Warhammer, Total War: PHARAOH wisely steps away from turning leaders into demigod-like figures portrayed as superhero like units. This is a more grounded approach that aligns well with the historical setting and the tone of the game. Although, it still features immortal leaders, which limits the potential for alternate stories and character deaths.

üó∫Campaign

The heart of PHARAOH is its campaign mode, a complex web of diplomacy, resource management, and warfare. Building and governing your Egyptian dynasty is no small feat. Players navigate the world through a familiar top-down isometric view, where cities are spread across the whole region.

Diplomacy plays a pivotal role, allowing you to interact with neighboring factions, forge alliances, and pursue your strategic objectives. Total War players will find themselves at ease with the user interface and mechanics, which have become staples of the series.

Each faction in Total War: PHARAOH brings its own unique flavor to the campaign. Players can choose to lead the mighty Egyptians, the resurgent Hittites, or other distinctive factions. These factions have their distinct units, culture, and playstyles, the developers have really tried their best do differentiate these so that every campaign feels different.

üèòOutposts, Religions, and Economy

A significant new addition to Total War: PHARAOH's city management is the introduction of outposts. These outposts, smaller than traditional cities, allow players to strategically position their influence across the map. This feature requires careful consideration of what type of outpost to build, adding a layer of strategy to the game. Defensive and economic outposts can be crucial for maintaining a growing empire, while outposts related to faith support the religious aspect of gameplay. This feature is a nice addition to the game and perhaps livens up the rather bland region we are playing in.

The game also introduces a pantheon of deities that players can worship, each granting unique bonuses. Worshipping up to three gods at a time, you gain access to their shrines and temples. A nice touch to the game, but something we have seen before in previous titles.

Resource management and trade is at the core of the economic system in Total War: PHARAOH. The game's Bronze Age setting offers an array of resources and a slightly different take on trading. These resources are not only essential for maintaining your armies and settlements but also for trading with other factions. As a player, you must strike a balance between resource production, trade, and military expenditure to ensure the growth and prosperity of your empire.

Establishing trade routes is a crucial aspect of the game's economic strategy. You can form alliances and trade agreements with neighboring factions to secure access to their resources and expand your trade network. This network can provide your empire with valuable resources that might be otherwise unavailable, enabling you to maintain strong armies and develop your settlements.

‚öîÔ∏èBattles

Battles in the game largely follow the tried-and-true formula of the Total War series. Players deploy their troops according to their strategic plans, and the chaos of battle unfolds. However, units in Total War: PHARAOH feel more substantial, granting players greater control over their movements. Leaders, while not equipped with the fantastical abilities seen in titles like Total War: Warhammer, fit seamlessly into the historical context of the game.

Total War: PHARAOH maintains the classic feel of Total War battles, but with some exciting dynamic features. Each battle begins with a weather forecast, introducing weather effects that influence the course of the fight. These weather conditions can either boost or hinder your forces, adding an extra layer of strategy. For instance, a battle in the rain might reduce archers' accuracy, while fog can obscure visibility. These weather dynamics inject freshness into the battles, making them more engaging and dynamic.

üìäTechnical Performance and additional drawbacks

The game also ran perfectly on my i7-8700k, RTX 3080 PC, which was surprising as Total War games tends to be one of the most CPU-heavy games I play, and my processor is 6 years old at this point. My game ran smoothly, even in large battles. Although I can‚Äôt help but notice that the graphics engine, while still impressive in most respects, is showing signs of aging. LOD pop-ins are still a problem, and animations still looks clunky sometimes. Enemy units 1v1-ing each other locked in an animation is back and is now a problem again that I can‚Äôt overlook, in which games like Rome and Medieval 2 infinitely did better.

One of the game's notable downsides is the AI, which can sometimes display baffling behavior, both for your enemies and your own units. This means fair amount of micromanagement during battles. While this can be a bit frustrating, it doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience. Fortunately you can pause the game speed during battles.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Total War: PHARAOH is a solid entry in the Total War series. While it may not reach the heights of Total War: Warhammer, Three Kingdoms, or Medieval II, it is a game well worth playing for Total War enthusiasts, and even for those diving in for the first time. I would say that for newcomers, this is a viable first game, as it doesn't redefine the series or set the bar higher. This means you'll still be able to enjoy older games in the series without a significant downgrade in the experience, but it some respects it feels like an expansion instead of a true sequel, Also, the price is a bit higher than usual, but overall it offers a robust strategy experience with excellent campaign mechanics, large scale battles, great presentation, and a refreshing bold new era.
