The eighth main installment in the iconic Resident Evil series is now available to play on iPhone 15 Pro and supported iPad models with an M1 chipset or better. The game is available as a free demo, with in-app purchases allowing players to unlock the full game, and its DLCs. Currently at a discounted price of $15.99 for the base game.

I played the game on an iPad Pro M1 model, which is probably in the middle tier hardware with regards to all the compatible devices. To get a grasp of the full mobile experience, I decide to alternate playing this with the touchscreen controls along with a proper gamepad connected via bluetooth.

For the touch controls, it features virtual on-screen gamepads but there’s really no full implementation. The developers just slapped a customizable virtual joystick overlay on top of the game and called it a day, at least its customizable though.

The game supports most mainstream controllers like PlayStation or Xbox gamepad, and they’re basically the superior way of experiencing this game. I’d highly recommend bringing a controller with you whether you are playing this on an iPad or an iPhone.

In terms of graphical settings, the game supports changing graphic settings, resolutions, and FPS just like a PC version would do. The freedom to do so is nice, but it would be nice to have an optimized setting depending on the device so people wouldn’t have to tinker.

It supports four sets of resolutions from 1280x894 to 2388x1668 and up to 120 FPS max, although running it on an iPad Pro M1 model, the 1280x894 setting at mostly low settings seems to be the sweet spot in terms of getting a decent 30FPS. The option to increase the graphics are probably there for future, more powerful chips. Setting up the foundation for more Apple AAA gaming which is nice. The game does not use the full resolution of the display, and opts to display the game at a standard 16:9 aspect ratio.

Although the developers have already added a third-person mode to the game for the PC and console versions, it appears that the Apple version doesn't include this feature and is limited to the first-person mode.

The audio for this game is a currently bugged, with noticeably sync and delay issues throughout my experience especially in cutscenes. probably because the framerates can't keep up with the audio playback resulting in delay. While these audio problems don't necessarily make the game unplayable, they do have a negative impact on the overall presentation and the immersive quality of cutscenes.

Despite these initial technical issues, the game is actually playable if you are okay with compromises to the visuals in exchange for portability. Even with the visual compromises, the game still looks good anyway. If you haven't played the game yet, and happen to have a compatible Apple device capable to run it, then you now have a compelling to option to do so, at a bargain price of $16.
