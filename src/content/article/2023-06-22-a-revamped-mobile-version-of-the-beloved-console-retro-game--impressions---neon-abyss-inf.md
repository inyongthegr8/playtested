Neon Abyss: Infinite, the revamped mobile version of the beloved PC and console retro game, brings the addictive gameplay and stylish retro aesthetics to the mobile platform. This adaptation to touch controls is well-executed, providing players with a seamless experience on their mobile devices. Although the game retains its core mechanics and charm, it introduces some changes, including free-to-play elements and gacha mechanics. While Neon Abyss: Infinite shows great promise, it is important to note that the game is in Early Access, and therefore, still requires optimization and improvement.

Compared to the original version, Neon Abyss: Infinite stays true to its roots, offering the same gameplay experience as its PC and console counterparts. Players venture through procedurally generated levels filled with enemies, power-ups, and challenging bosses.

Neon Abyss: Infinite incorporates roguelike elements, meaning that each run is unique, with randomly generated rooms, enemy placements, and item drops. This adds immense replay value as players can experience different combinations of challenges and rewards with each playthrough. The game also features persistent upgrades and unlockable items that carry over between runs, allowing players to progressively become stronger and more versatile.

Across the levels, players can acquire and swap between different firearms, magical abilities, and passive upgrades, creating dynamic and diverse gameplay experiences. The game also introduces eggs that can hatch into various companions after some time, and if it results in a successful hatch, can provide different bonuses and support during battles

One of the surprising changes in Neon Abyss: Infinite is the shift to a free-to-play model with added cosmetics and gacha mechanics, which aren’t entirely needed to enjoy the game. This move aims to make the game more accessible to mobile gamers and capitalize on the popularity of these monetization methods.
