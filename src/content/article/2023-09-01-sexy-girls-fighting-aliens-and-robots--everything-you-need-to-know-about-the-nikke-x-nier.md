Developed by Shift Up, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, or Nikke is a free-to-play sci-fi shooter that has garnered attention for its action-packed gameplay and, well, it's rather unique exaggerated physics. The game features a cast of buxom waifu characters, each armed to the teeth and ready for action. While the gameplay itself is no joke, what really sets Nikke apart is its over the shoulder and cover action, and playful approach to character movement, where the recoil from shooting causes certain assets to, shall we say, exhibit quite noticeable jiggle. It's unapologetically over-the-top, and players have embraced it for its fan service fun.

Nikke presents a compelling story-driven gameplay experience set in a dystopian future where humanity has sought refuge underground, battling mechanical aliens known as Raptures. Players assume the role of a Commander, leading a squad of Nikkes—powerful artificial soldiers—on a mission to reclaim the Earth's surface from the Raptures. The narrative unfolds through missions, encounters, and dialogues; and interweaves with the game's action-based battle system, featuring quick character-switching, elemental strategies, and intense third-person shooter combat. Players face waves of enemies and powerful bosses, utilizing a variety of firearms and abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses. Together, the narrative and gameplay create a dynamic and immersive experience, blending action, strategy, and storytelling into a thrilling adventure.

On the other end of the spectrum, we have the AAA game Nier: Automata, an actually critically acclaimed and emotionally charged action RPG developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. The game's narrative explores the fate of humanity through the eyes of attractive androids, 2B and A2, as they battle to save a world on the brink of doom. Known for its thought-provoking themes and mesmerizing soundtrack by composer Keiichi Okabe, Nier: Automata is widely regarded as a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of storytelling in video games.

The latest collaboration between Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Nier: Automata is now live. Both Nikke and Nier: Automata have not been short of collaboration events with other franchises, such as Chainsaw Man with Nikke, or Nier: Automata with even more ridiculous crossovers like Rainbow Six: Siege, PUBG, and Fall Guys. However, both games might have found a match made in heaven with what might be the most sensical crossover yet, featuring very similar themes: sexy girls fighting aliens and robots.

The newly announced collaboration, launched on September 1, 2023 with a second part launching next week September 8, brings the leading ladies of Nier: Automata - 2B and A2 plus Pascal - into the harsh world of Nikke. Players will have the opportunity to take control of these iconic androids, and yes, things are getting a little cheeky.

The two wildly different but somehow still close enough gaming universes are colliding in what promises to be an epic fusion of melee and gun toting sci-fi action, and a touch of hotness.
