We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie
We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie is a remastered version of the beloved second title in the Katamari Damacy series released for modern systems; PC, Playstation, Xbox, and Switch.


**Pros:**


+Unique and whimsical gameplay

+Charming simplistic visuals

+Creative level design

+Catchy Soundtrack


**Cons:**


-Controls are a bit unorthodox at first

-Still no camera controls

We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie is an enhanced edition of the classic PS2 from 2005 that takes players on a whimsical and quirky adventure as they step into the shoes of the Prince once again, as well as the King of All Cosmos during his boyhood.

The graphics have been overhauled for modern systems, but still retains that simple low poly aesthetic — it is still the charming and vibrant Katamari world that fans know. From the colorful landscapes to the quirky characters, every aspect of the game is even more visually captivating than before.

But it's not just about the visuals. We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie also comes with gameplay refinements that make it even more enjoyable. The controls have been fine-tuned, offering controller as well as keyboard support for alternative rolling as you gather objects and build your katamari.

We Love Katamari REROLL+ is an absolute piece of insanity and absurdity. From the moment you start rolling that sticky ball, you're catapulted into a world where logic takes a backseat and chaos literally reigns supreme. The game throws you into a whirlwind of bizarre scenarios, outrageous characters, and mind-bending environments that defy any sense of normalcy.

It takes players on the adventures of the Prince and his colorful and eccentric family, known as the King of All Cosmos and the Queen. The story begins with the King of All Cosmos accidentally destroying all the stars in the sky while on a stargazing trip. In order to rectify this cosmic disaster, the King enlists the help of his tiny son, the Prince, to roll up objects on Earth and recreate the stars. Despite the simplicity of the story, We Love Katamari's charm lies in its absurdity and whimsical nature, as well as its pretty mesmerizing gameplay.

In We Love Katamari REROLL+, the simple act of rolling a sticky ball, called a Katamari, takes center stage, creating a strangely addictive and mesmerizing gameplay loop. With its charming visuals, catchy and as equally as weird soundtrack, and an array of creative levels, We Love Katamari is a true gem in the world of video games that finally had its well deserved remaster.

At its core, We Love Katamari REROLL+ is all about rolling that sticky ball around various environments and collecting as many objects as possible to make the ball grow bigger. The larger the Katamari becomes, the more massive and diverse objects it can pick up.

Starting from humble beginnings, players are tasked with rolling up small objects, trash objects or room clutter, gradually progressing to collect larger items such as cats, bicycles, and even buildings. The mechanics are simple and easy to grasp, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.

The controls overall are kind of hard to grasp at first, especially that you need to use both sticks or dual four directional buttons (WASD and IJKL) to roll the Katamari around, but after a while, it gets intuitive and just becomes second nature. The HD in-game UI — now with proper 16:9 support — adds to the overall ease of play, making it accessible for both newcomers and fans of the original game. However, you still cannot control your camera properly and are at the mercy of the game's auto camera function when rolling the Katamari around.

The physics-based movement of the ball feels satisfying and realistic, yet absurdly entertaining, albeit sometimes frustrating, as it sticks to various objects and rolls with unpredictable momentum. The game also introduced new gameplay mechanics compared to the first game, including the ability to perform special moves such as jumps and spins, adding depth and variety to the rolling experience.

We Love Katamari REROLL+ features a wide range of imaginative and whimsical levels. From a bustling cityscape to a tranquil countryside, each level is filled with unique challenges and surprises. The game features a fantastic blend of environments, ranging from ordinary household settings to extraordinary fantasy realms. It's always satisfying to progress the transformation of a small Katamari into a colossal ball rolling through vibrant and colorful landscapes

Conclusion:

We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie is a game that revels in its own insanity and absurdity. From the ludicrous concept and satisfying gameplay of rolling up everything in sight to the mind-boggling levels and eccentric characters, it's a game that embraces chaos and delivers an experience that is delightfully bonkers.
