POPUCOM is an upcoming multiplayer cooperative puzzle adventure platformer that emphasizes color-switching, match-3 shooting, and utilizing various companions cooperatively to progress through a mysterious vibrant world. Recently announced a few days ago with a trailer and mini-game (more info further down below) to go along with it, the game is set to be released for PC and PlayStation, offering a multiplayer cooperative puzzle adventure experience.

POPUCOM transports players to a foreign world where they must collaborate with friends to restore life to a ravaged planet. Judging from the game’s trailer, the game's central gameplay mechanic revolves around match-3 color-switching, requiring players to change colors to match specific mechanisms and solve puzzles.

Story

Story

Looking at some information online, the story seems to be set in a parallel Earth, where corporate greed leads to pollution and the birth of a mutant creature named "Paom'l." As the planet faces peril, a dying doctor implants his will into a robot. A century later, the robot initiates a crucial program. Boys and girls from other worlds are summoned to save the planet by defeating Paom'l. This sets the stage for POPUCOM's cooperative multiplayer puzzle adventure, where players must work together to combat the mutant threat and restore hope to their ravaged world. Of course, take this information with a grain of salt.

Here are my key takeaways from the trailer, announcement, and the Steam game page.

Here are my key takeaways from the trailer, announcement, and the Steam game page.

Color-Based Gameplay: Colors play a significant role in POPUCOM. Players must strategically switch their colors to match various mechanisms in the game, triggering different effects and overcoming obstacles.
Multiplayer Cooperative Play: The game emphasizes teamwork, allowing 2-4 players to enjoy cooperative play with friends, offering both online as well as split-screen mode (as seen in the trailer). Players will need to work together to progress through the challenges presented in the game.
Third person shooter elements: POPUCOM introduces the Rainbow Popper, a tool that lets players shoot Pomus to generate more of the same color. Matching three Pomus of the same color eliminates threats as well.
At least four characters: Various companions, such as Rollo the Bomb, Captain Kitty, Barrier Bot, and Power Kid. 
Customization: The game offers a ‘Closet’ feature that allows players to customize their characters.

Split-screen is alive

Split-screen is alive

The resurgence of split-screen cooperative games, spearheaded by the 2021 Game Awards Game of the Year winner, "It Takes Two," marks a heartwarming return to the roots of shared gaming experiences. It reminds us of the sheer joy and camaraderie that local co-op gaming can provide, offering a refreshing break from the ultra-competitive titles saturating the multiplayer market today. With the announcement of POPUCOM, it appears that another promising cooperative gem is on the horizon.

No official release date has been provided for POPUCOM at this time. As more information becomes available, fans can anticipate further details about this multiplayer puzzle adventure.
