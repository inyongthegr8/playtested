Four games join forces to create an epic crossover experience across mobile and PC; Riot Games’ League of Legends: Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra, Teamfight Tactics, and League of Legends itself.

It marks the first time Riot Games has orchestrated such a vast, interconnected experience across its mobile and PC, weaving a grand crossover of excitement and adventure across its gaming universe. The event is set to take players on an unforgettable journey filled with new game modes, exclusive skins, and epic battles until August, for all four games across various platforms including iOS and Android, at least for its mobile game offerings like League of Legends: Wild Rift.

League of Legends: Wild Rift will receive six alluring Soul Fighter skins that allow players to embody the essence of these legendary champions in a way never seen before; Nilah, two versions of Draven, Yasuo, Irelia, Xin Zhao.

There is a "Soul Fighter Bounty" special promotion that offers players a chance to obtain the Special Edition skin of Draven. Players will need to purchase boxes, each priced at 400 Wild Cores. These boxes offer an opportunity to receive various rewards, including the rare and exclusive Soul Fighter Draven (Special Edition) skin for a 0.50% chance, as well as differing rates of vouchers that can also be used to purchase other skins, emotes, and other in-game cosmetics.

The event also brings an exclusive in-client narrative experience to Wild Rift. Step into the shoes of Draven and Yasuo, two champions whose destinies intertwined with the enigmatic Soul Fighters. Unravel the secrets and mysteries of this captivating universe through an immersive visual novel experience.

In addition to the new skins and narrative experience, Tag Duel is also a brand-new game mode, tailor-made for the fast-paced mobile experience of Wild Rift – albeit on a limited run. Players will engage in intense 1v1 encounters, where the primary goal is to secure multiple kills against opponents, showcasing their skill with not one but three champions. The Tag Duel mode is available exclusively during the "Soul Fighter" event, commencing on July 21st and concluding on August 7th.

Prior to the duel, Summoners will carefully select three champions from their vast roster which will share a single health bar for the fight. During the battle, players can then seamlessly switch between their three chosen champions. However, this strategic maneuver will consume super meter charges, adding an element of resource management.

All cooldowns are refunded during character switches, encouraging swapping and synergistic combos between champions. For the itemization, champions will automatically purchase items and level up throughout the match, streamlining the gameplay experience and keeping the focus on the intense combat.

In Teamfight Tactics on the other hand, the event brings a new game mode called Soul Brawl, along with a narrative experience and an Event Pass. Players can also enjoy the addition of Chibi Gwen and Chibi Soul Fighter Gwen as new tacticians. Meanwhile, Legends of Runeterra features a new event pass along with emotes, cosmetics, and cardbacks during the Soul Fighter event.

Getting the most content out of all, League of Legends brings thrilling new game modes called 2v2v2v2 Arena and the fighting mini-game Tournament of Souls. In Arena, four teams of two players each engage in rotating combat rounds. After each round, teams power up with unique Augments until only one team remains victorious. The battles take place in four different battlefields, each varying in size, terrain density, and theme. The event also introduces a formidable new champion named Naafiri, the Hound of a Hundred Bite, plus new Soul Fighter themed skins, some of them with Prestige versions.

Across all the four games, the Soul Fighter cross game summer event is a limited-time event only, from July 20 to August 28.
