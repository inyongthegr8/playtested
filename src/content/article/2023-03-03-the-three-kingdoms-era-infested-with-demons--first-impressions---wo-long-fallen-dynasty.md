Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced, action-packed RPG that draws inspiration from the Souls-like genre popularized by Dark Souls and recently, Elden Ring.

Developed by KOEI and published by Team Ninja, players take on the role of a customizable protagonist and are inserted in a world of historical fantasy set in the Three-Kingdoms Era, complete with demons. Players must battle their way through hordes of demons and historical figures using a variety of weapons, spells, and skills; and must rise from zero to hero.

The story is an interesting mix of Chinese history but on steroids, kind of like the game series Dynasty Warriors but set in a much darker tone with the inclusion of demons.

One of my most anticipated aspects is the flashy combat system. Like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the game places a heavy emphasis on parrying, which can be used to quickly turn the tables on enemies and deal devastating damage. While blocking and dodging are also viable options, parrying is the most effective way to defeat many of the game's bosses, making it a key skill for players to master. The combat is highly fast-paced, filled with constant hits, blocks, and parries that are so satisfying and gratifying to do and never gets old.

However, players must also manage their spirit gauge, which is a modified version of a typical stamina system. It is depleted by most actions such as blocking, dodging, or casting a spell. If players overextend themselves and use too much spirit, their character will become fatigued and temporarily unable to take any actions. To replenish the spirit gauge, players must strike with light attacks instead of letting it regenerate on its own.

This is an amazing change to the formula that encourages fast-paced action and constant trade-offs with the enemy, not allowing room for ultra-defensive and evasive combat styles from players.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty features a linear mission-based structure, and there are also side missions that you can consider. These missions culminate in a boss fight at the end, which is another highlight of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. The game features a diverse range of bosses, from small human vs. human battles to giant enemy encounters. Including famous generals and warlords from the Three Kingdoms era, such as Lu Bu and Cao Cao.

Despite being a singleplayer oriented experience, the game also features co-op play features, so its great news for players who are looking to play and get social. You can summon up to two friends to help you with tough enemies and boss fights. The invasion system from the Dark Souls series is also adapted and present in the game, allowing for some PvP action.

Each encounter requires a different approach and strategy, and it is generally a forgiving mechanic, as long as you've mastered the enemy telegraphs and move sets as well as your own. I've had no frustrations, so it must be relatively well balanced.

The fast-paced and relentless combat mechanics are challenging and engaging, requiring players to stay focused and adapt to various enemy types and attack patterns. This kind of combat system can provide a satisfying sense of achievement when successfully defeating a tough enemy or boss, and instills a relentless determination to achieve success while in the process of beating them.

So far, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is looking like a game that will scratch that itch that Sekiro and Nioh have left, and provide both a great extension of the Souls-like genre, and a refreshing take on the formula.
