Kemono Friends: Kingdom is an upcoming gacha game featuring cute waifu characters wearing animal themed outfits. It is currently tagged as coming soon for both Android, with pre-registration now available, while the iOS version is available for Malaysia and Singapore regions.

The main focus of the game is collecting the different "animal girls" to assist you in battling the various monsters in an abandoned large-scale theme park where these animals girls reside. This Kingdom is a vast region with its varying landscape like grasslands, forests, and deserts.

The combat is unlike anything I've seen yet for a mobile gacha game, but is still kind of familiar with its Angry Birds-like gameplay.  You adjust the trajectory of the character and launch her to enemies, trying to circumvent any obstacles or platforms the level might present, upon landing she then attacks it with her special abilities. It's pretty unexpected to see these kind of gameplay style mixed-up with a character collecting gacha game, but this looks like a fun and exciting game to try regardless.

The game features Japanese voice acting for the characters, but it is expected to have various text localizations including English and Chinese. Of course, it features a typical gacha visual novel style story to drive the game forward, starting with an Isekai premise where your character is magically transported to this world of Kingdom, without memories, and are found by two animal girls.

As said earlier, pre-registration is now available, so if you're interested, this is the perfect chance to sign-up and get updates for any release information or upcoming playtest!
