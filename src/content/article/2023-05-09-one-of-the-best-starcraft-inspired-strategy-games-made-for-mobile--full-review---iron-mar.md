Iron Marines is a real time strategy game released for mobile devices originally back in 2017, and has since been ported to PC, and then recently released as Iron Marines+, a version of the game that is exclusive to Apple Arcade, a subscription-based gaming service offered by Apple.

In Iron Marines+, players take on the role of the titular Iron Marines, an elite group of soldiers tasked with defending humanity from various threats. The premise and setup is clearly inspired by Starcraft. The unit and building aesthetics, the enemies, and the whole gameplay setup will remind you of Starcraft, but cartoon-ized and made lighthearted. It also was built with touch controls in mind.

At its core, Iron Marines+ is a classic real-time strategy game that will feel familiar to fans of the genre. Players must build a base, gather resources, and train troops to defeat their enemies. Iron Marines+ also has hero units that can be upgraded and customized to suit the player's playstyle.

Players can choose from a roster of different heroes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyle. For example, some heroes are designed for long-range combat, while others excel in close-quarters combat. Each hero can be customized with different weapons and upgrades, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences. You start off with one hero, and unlock more as you finish more stages.

The hero units in Iron Marines+ are not just powerful combat units; they also serve as the player's avatar within the game and the leader of the army deployed to the battle. Each hero has their own unique backstory and personality, and they provide a sense of connection to the game world and add an additional flavor to an otherwise stale story.

In addition to the hero units, Iron Marines+ features a wide range of different troops, vehicles, and supports that players can use to defeat their enemies. From basic infantry units to heavily armored tanks and aircraft, there is a unit for every situation in Iron Marines. Players must carefully manage their resources to build the right mix of units to tackle each level's challenges. Some units can easily switch between other similar types while in the battlefield, providing for some nice tactical layers not seen in other games.

The gameplay in Iron Marines+ is fast-paced and challenging. Each level, and eventually, planet, presents players with a new set of objectives, ranging from simple base-building tasks to full-on battles against alien forces. The game does an excellent job of gradually ramping up the difficulty, introducing new enemies and challenges as players progress through the campaign that spans multiple stages and planets.

Each level is fairly crafted, with a unique layout and set of challenges that requires players to use different strategies and tactics to succeed. Some levels feature large open areas where players must defend their base against waves of enemies, while others take place in cramped underground tunnels where players must carefully navigate their troops to avoid traps and ambushes.

The game features colorful, vibrant, and detailed environments; and the character models are full of charm and features cartoon-esque designs. The animations are smooth and fluid, and the 2D special effects are impressive, especially during large-scale battles with many units on screen.

While the game's controls were built with touch controls in mind and generally works for the most part, it can be a bit clunky at times, especially on smaller phone screens. Some players may find it difficult to select individual units or issue specific commands during large battles.

Conclusion:

Overall, Iron Marines+ is an excellent real-time strategy game and is probably one of the best Starcraft inspired strategy games made for mobile. The game's fast-paced gameplay, challenging levels, and satisfying combat make it a worthy try for any RTS fan looking to play something on Apple Arcade.
