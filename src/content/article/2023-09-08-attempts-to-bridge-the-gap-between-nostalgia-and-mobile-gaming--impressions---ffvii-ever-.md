Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is a part-compilation, part remaster gacha game that beautifully blends elements from the original 1997 release and the more recent FF7 spin-offs and remakes.

The game features both charming Chibi-style character designs for the story segments while incorporating the modern ultra-detailed graphics of the recent games during combat sequences. So far it achieves a nice balance of the two styles,

As for the combat, Ever Crisis retains the turn-based combat system from the original Final Fantasy VII. The Active Time Battle (ATB) system returns, allowing players to interrupt an opponent's turn to execute skills and magic.  It pays homage to the original while adding a layer of strategy to battles. Of course, as a gacha game, you can automate and fast forward the combat.

A lot of the game modes are unlocked early on, including the three main stories (FF7, Crisis Core, and First Soldier), but the difficulty is a bit steep when it comes to meeting the necessary power levels, which are part of the aggressive gacha mechanics of the game.

Almost every aspect of the game seems monetized, making it feel like free-to-play gaming at its most aggressive. Shame, because the actual combat and story is actually done really well and encapsulates the entire FF7 saga in a neat and fun way. Money won’t solve everything though, as Ever Crisis releases its story content in monthly installments, which would still require players to wait for more content.

Still, if you're a big fan of Final Fantasy VII, it's worth downloading and trying out—provided that you are located in one of the supported regions. Ever Crisis doesn't seem to support all regions, particularly in SEA countries, requiring the use of a VPN. Players in those countries can try using a VPN for the UK or US region to see if the game will connect.
