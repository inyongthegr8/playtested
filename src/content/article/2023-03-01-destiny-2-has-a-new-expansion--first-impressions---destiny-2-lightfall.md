Destiny 2: Lightfall comes with a new storyline, a new playable area, and refined game mechanics to the long-standing popular MMORPG FPS game.

For the uninitiated, the base game - Destiny 2, is a free-to-play MMORPG FPS game where players take on the role of a Guardian, a protector of Earth's last city, and engage in various activities such as story missions, strikes, raids, and PvP battles.

The game's overarching premise involves defending the solar system against various threats, including hostile alien races and otherworldly forces. The entire premise takes form as a sci-fi story mixed with fantasy elements.

With the new expansion, The planet Neptune is added as a whole new destination for players to explore and continues the same visually impressive graphics with its neon-lit cyberpunk looking secret city of Neomuna located on Neptune.

Despite being the fifth major expansion to a second game in the series, You don’t need to have played Destiny 1, or have bought any expansions if you want to dive into Destiny 2: Lightfall. The game expansion is standalone and can stand on its own as both a welcoming experience for newcomers and an expansion to existing players. However, it's recommended to play through the base game Destiny 2 first.

The expansion also introduces three new subclasses, new exotic weapons and armor, and increases the difficulty of basic activities, while decreasing ability cooldowns.  Further refining the content you can experience in Destiny 2.

The added new campaign for Lightfall is quite short. Coming in from the Witch Queen expansion, I find it a bit underwhelming and there isn’t enough stakes for the story nor enough explanation given to the player to care or to be amazed.

So far, Destiny 2: Lightfall adds further quality content to an already expansive MMORPG FPS game, however I'm not quite sure if the $50 asking price is worth it for these additional content, considering the base game is already free-to-play. Still, for newcomers, this seems like a good time to try out Destiny 2.
