Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge is a digital collectible card battler set in the grimdark future of the 41st millennium. It's a game that allows players to step into the war-torn universe of Warhammer 40k and engage in strategic card battle. It carries the rich lore and factions of the Warhammer universe and uses it as a basis to create a card battler game.

The game, currently in soft launch for Android, iOS, and PC, offers a blend of strategic card combat and a deep connection to the Warhammer 40k lore. Players can assemble decks based on their chosen faction and engage in battles that capture the essence of the tabletop experience.

Warpforge effectively implements well-established concepts in the collectible card game genre. The core gameplay revolves around energy management, where players must carefully allocate their energy to play cards. More powerful cards require more energy, and the energy pool increases incrementally and replenishes each turn, resulting in more chaos as the battle wages on.

The cards in the game are not limited to a single attack stat; they have two: melee and ranged. This dual-attribute system adds a significant layer of strategic complexity to the game. The diverse range of factions also offers a varied and strategic gameplay experience. The factions aren’t just reskins of each other with different card designs and effects. They fundamentally work differently.

However, the game isn’t without its issues. I feel that it still needs more balancing regarding cards’ health points and damages, especially that cards, especially weak ones are often eliminated as soon as they are played. Since most played cards cannot attack until the nxet turn, this means that many cards WILL come and go without even doing anything meaningful to the match.

The game is also brutally difficult to master. It took me a lot of losses before I was able to come up with my first win. I think it’s safe to safe that I was already playing with real players even at my first match, that or the starting bots are too advanced for beginners.
