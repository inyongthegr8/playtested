You have exactly 28 days left to reach the bunker before they bomb the city. You have your trusty car, and a new cat for a companion. You need to stop for gas once a day, and has 4 bullets remaining. Can you survive all 28 days in 1 Bit Survivor?

1 Bit Survivor is a straightforward rogue-lite survival horror in portrait view. The presentation and the atmosphere is definitely classic Resident Evil 2 and 3-style, an obvious inspiration especially with sound bits when starting a session and the menacing sound effects that you hear. On the contrary, the gameplay is far from it with its subtle 1-bit retro game design and stylized monochromatic graphics.

1 Bit Survivor kind of plays like a rogue-like where you need to survive the 28 days, or die trying and have to restart from day 1 again. Start off in a random level biome: sewers, hospitals, graveyards, etc. They are just visual flavor and do not really make a difference with enemies or item spawns. Every 7 days the biomed changes and the game gets slightly harder.

The controls are a bit hard at first, it feels like everything is in a rush with its small cramped levels, thankfully you can tweak the settings and the position of the gun fire button to your liking. I find it better when it is in the center of the D-Pad for movement, and it controls like the old Resident Evil games for some reason.

Even though the game has ultra simplistic mechanics, the tactical aspect caught my attention. The game doesn't explicitly tell you this, but 1 Bit Survivor is sort of turn-based where the game only continues when you are performing an action. If you don’t move, everything else won’t either. So there’s no point in rushing. Once you get the hang of it, the game will be much easier.

Aside from using your pistol with limited ammo, you can also melee the infected, but you risk getting damaged and your health depleted. Different enemies have different durabilities, some will go down in 1 hit, some multiple gunshots or melee attacks. This makes some encounters pretty intense because not everything dies instantly.

Some choices require you to forego an ammo or health pickup so you can escape and not risk death if there are still enemies present, or to carefully balance your supplies; maybe deplete your ammo first before going on an ammo pickup, or in order to save ammo, you can try and exchange melee hits with an enemy first before taking that health pickup.

1 Bit Survivor has very simplistic graphics and mechanics, but it is still effective in portraying a proper survival horror experience with its tactical decision making elements and rogue-like progression system. Very simple to play, but hard to master.
