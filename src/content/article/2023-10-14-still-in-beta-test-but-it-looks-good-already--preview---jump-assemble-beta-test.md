‚ú®Overview

JUMP: Assemble is upcoming Anime-based MOBA for fans of the genre and anime enthusiasts alike. This game unites beloved manga and anime characters from Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump series in epic 5v5 team battles.

JUMP: Assemble offers an exciting crossover that brings characters like Monkey D. Luffy, Naruto, Goku, Kamado Tanjiro, and more into the arena. It features characters from eighth different Weekly Shonen Jump properties: One Piece. Dragon Ball. Naruto. Bleach. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen, Undead, Unluck, Mashle: Magic and Muscles.

üößLimited Beta Test

This game made is currently on a limited slots beta testing, and I was fortunate to be among those who was able to join in. Slots have been consistently opened for three consecutive days, so far always at around 11 AM GMT+8.

Upon creating your avatar and completing a set of tutorials, you step into the third-person mode lobby, a vibrant 3D space brimming with various sections, including different game modes such as normal and ranked play, and the store. It's still somewhat barebones; there's no background music yet in some scenes. However, this extra element adds a nice touch considering it's a MOBA game.

üì∫Graphics, Art-style and Voice-overs

The game presents itself with cel-shaded visuals that are crisp and vibrant. The battleground, called  the "All-Star Arena," draws inspiration from various anime worlds, with elements reminiscent of Dragon Ball, One Piece, and others with its monsters, towers, and map.

The character animations and skills are amazing and tantalizing, and for anime fans, this is where JUMP: Assemble captures the anime feel. The attention to detail in replicating characters like Naruto or Goku in 3D cel-shaded form commonly seen in modern Anime video games now.

Furthermore, characters come with original voice-overs, adding authenticity to the experience. While some voice-overs are still in progress, the promise of complete character voice-overs upon the game's official release is exciting.

Aside from the overall gameplay format, the UI design seems to borrow exact elements from Mobile Legends and features a comic-book style aesthetics. Manga panels serve as background visuals, and everything here seems very immersive for an Anime-inspired video game.

üéÆGameplay

If you're familiar with mobile MOBA games, then this is easy to pick up and play. It feels exactly like Mobile Legends, even the announcer‚Äôs voice and lines are heavily inspired by and sounds very similar.

Jump Assemble offers a familiar MOBA experience, allowing players to choose from various roles, including Mage, Fighter, Jungler, Support, and Tank. The three-lane layout, with top, mid, and bottom lanes, provides a classic MOBA structure .The variety in character abilities and roles ensures that players have plenty of options to suit their preferences. Of course, I expect the support will be the least favorite role, as usual.

The game introduces unique elements, such as red and blue buffs spawning at the 30-second mark and the first objective at the two-minute mark. Players can reach a maximum level of 15, with access to their ultimate ability at level 4. Battle Skills, Flash skills, Retribution skills for Junglers, and Scoot for temporary movement speed boosts add depth to the gameplay. This is almost an exact replica of the Mobile Legends‚Äô formula, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing as it means its going to be easy to pick up and get popular.

The game is enjoyable, with various character types and diverse skills. Examples include AOE attacks, movement skills, stuns, heals, and knockbacks.

‚è´Progression

The game allows you to select one free starting character, which can be either Luffy, Naruto, or Goku. The rest of the characters can be unlocked by playing and earning points or by spending money to purchase characters and cosmetics. Progression is further incentivized through live service elements such as daily logins, events, and passes.

In my case, I chose Luffy, but I won't be able to unlock Naruto or Goku next immediately. I'll have to go through other supporting characters first. This isn't a drawback, as they are all designed to be equally powerful and balanced, given it's a MOBA. Some are better suited for killing, others for tanking, and some for support. If you want to play your favorite character, the pressure is on to either grind or pay. As common in hero-based games, teams can't choose identical characters simultaneously, although two opposing teams can have the same characters facing each other.

Overall, the roster features 25 characters from eight prominent anime and manga series, including Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, Undead Unluck, and Mashle. Each character comes with a unique set of skills and abilities, catering to different playstyles. As mentioned earlier, unlocking characters involves playing and accumulating points or purchasing them with real money.

üìäTechnical Performance

The game looks sharp and crips, runs smoothly and is very stable from my testing, with no crashes or freezes experience. During my testing with my Snapdragon 888 device, it can reach up to a 90FPS ceiling. However, it doesn't feel as smooth as the indicators are showing, and the overall feel of the game seems closer to 30FPS for some reason.

Conclusion

JUMP: Assemble is an exciting MOBA addition that capitalizes the ultra popular Anime series with great effect, offering a unique blend of beloved anime characters, engaging MOBA gameplay, and beautiful visuals. While the closed beta is exclusively available to Android users in the Philippines, JUMP: Assemble is already looking good and has the potential achieve worldwide success upon its official release thanks to its strong Anime source material.
