**Cons:**

üìùNotable points:

These pros and cons are based on the soft launch version of Defense Derby available on Android.Some aspects of the game may have been updated or changed since the time of writing.

Defense Derby revolves around defending your square castle from waves of relentless monsters. Strategic placement of heroes atop the castle is crucial for survival. The game offers a diverse range of units inspired by the fantasy genre, including mages, archers, swordsmen, riflemen, and wizards. Each unit possesses unique attributes, attack ranges, and attack types, allowing players to develop diverse tactical approaches.

Defense Derby boasts an eye-catching visual style that blends vibrant cartoons with anime-inspired artwork. The in-game graphics feature a whimsical and stylized 3D design, immersing players in a visually appealing world. The characters are intricately detailed and possess a charming aesthetic reminiscent of popular mobile games like Clash Royale and beloved RPG classics like World of Warcraft. The visual presentation enhances the overall experience, complementing the addictive gameplay.

Defense Derby features a fun multiplayer mode, known as "Derby." In this mode, four players compete individually, in their own castles, to survive waves of enemies. The last castle standing emerges as the victorious player. Aside from watching your own castle defense, you can also spectate your opponents castles and see how they fare. What sets Derby apart is the innovative bidding system. Prior to each round, players construct their deck of cards by bidding on available options. Initially, players start with two cards, and subsequent bidding rounds determine additional cards and limit opponents' choices.

The bidding process is the backbone of the PvP gameplay in Defense Derby. It introduces a strategic layer where players must balance their resources and determine the optimal bid for each card. Winning bids secure desired cards, depleting opponents' options and resources. However, overbidding can result in resource scarcity for subsequent rounds, while underbidding risks losing access to vital units. The bidding system results in a compelling blend of resource management, psychological tactics, and calculated decision-making.

In addition to bidding, defeating boss monsters rewards players with extra cards, further incentivizing strategic gameplay. Synergy between units plays a crucial role, as combining similar units and positioning them strategically can significantly impact the outcome of battles. Players also have the ability to reposition units with a cooldown, allowing them to efficiently cover all sides of the castle depending on enemy position, using minimal resources.

Another primary gameplay mode in Defense Derby is the singleplayer "Blitz" mode, where players must overcome progressively challenging stages using a preselected lineup of units and heroes, this functions more like a traditional tower defense game, with no bidding and PvP elements.

Roster wise, Defense Derby offers a vast array of units and heroes to unlock and collect, providing players with long-term goals and a variety of choices. The gacha-like system adds excitement and anticipation to the hero acquisition process, enhancing the sense of discovery and progression, but of course comes at a downside of introducing pay to win elements. As a live service game, Defense Derby goes beyond the core gameplay, offering various activities and events such as Adventure mode and Guilds. Defense Derby also features a progression system reminiscent of battle passes, offering tiered rewards to players who engage in continuous gameplay.

Conclusion:

Defense Derby delivers a refreshing and addictive multiplayer tower defense experience that sets it apart from its counterparts. The strategic depth of gameplay, driven by the innovative bidding mechanics, keeps players engaged and constantly challenged.
