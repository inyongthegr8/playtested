At first glance, Book of Hours appears as a difficult concept to understand, and it is absolutely true, much like the arcane secrets it promises to unveil. Developed by Weather Factory – the creators of another similar game in Cultist Simulator, Book of Hours captivates with its rich atmosphere and esoteric themes. Released on PC, it beckons players to explore the realms of the occult, inviting them to step into the shoes of an amnesiac librarian rebuilding a destroyed ancient library.

The core gameplay revolves around a card-based mechanic, where each card represents an action, item, or concept within the game's universe, and you must combine them with others to result in an outcome.  Most of the gameplay is centered around that concept, and even actions as mundane as speaking to a character about a topic, paying characters currency, or receiving rewards are all done via these card crafting system.

Early in the game, the protagonist — devoid of any memories — stumbles upon a village and eventually unlocks access to the central stage of the game: The Hush House. This dilapidated grand library must be painstakingly rebuilt, one room at a time, with the help of the villagers living nearby. Of course, this endeavor comes at a cost, requiring you to earn various currencies and favors to afford the repair and restoration of the library. The game, along with its actions and crafting, plays out in a real-time pausable manner, complete with a day/night cycle that refreshes the character’s energy, memories, and rerolls new sets of potential visitors and characters to interact with.

Somewhat of a miracle, but somehow, many of the books inside the library have survived, albeit in dire need of management. Book of Hours embraces its central premise with fervor, allowing players to acquire and investigate occult books, catalog them, gain knowledge, and meet other visitors and scholars along the way.

As evident in the first few minutes of the game, Book of Hours is not for the majority of people out there. If you loved Cultist Simulator, you're probably going to like this game. However, for newcomers venturing in blindly, there's a good chance that this game might not resonate with you. If you're open-minded toward experimental and unconventional gameplay mechanics, value substance over style, and don't mind a relatively passive gameplay experience, then this game is probably right up your alley to try.
