Red Ronin is a turn-based dash 'n slash game that follows the story of a bloodthirsty ronin named Red, seeking revenge alongside her companion bot, ISAAC. Betrayed by her former team, Red sets out on a relentless journey for revenge.

As players control Red and ISAAC, they navigate through a variety of challenging levels that combine strategic decision-making with turn-based puzzle-like combat sequences, providing a unique blend of gameplay mechanics.

The visuals in Red Ronin boast a captivating retro-inspired aesthetic that blends samurai and cyberpunk elements very well. The game's art direction pays homage to classic pixel art styles, evoke a sense of nostalgia while capturing the essence of a dystopian cyberpunk setting. Accompanying the captivating visuals is a lo-fi 16-bit music soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's retro-cyberpunk atmosphere.

The gameplay revolves around Red, a Samurai so fast that she cannot stop her own movements—only walls and furniture can. Initially, the movement mechanics felt weird, allowing the player to only make dash movements in one direction, one turn at a time. The dash is unstoppable until Red encounters walls or obstacles, resembling how tiles are moved in the game 2048. Players dash until Red bumps into something, then in the next turn, dash again in another direction. There are no limits to the dash; it's possible to cross an entire room in one turn, as long as there are no obstacles in the way.

The controls are somewhat lazily done for the Android version. The developers just slapped a virtual gamepad overlay on the screen and called it a day. However, it surprisingly works for the most part, and is non issue for how the game works.

Despite the initial weirdness of the movement mechanics, all of it makes sense pretty much immediately. The coolness factor sets in once you start to meet enemies and begin to slash them one by one like a badass lightning fast Samurai. Unfortunately, Red’s speed is to her own detriment, as mistimed movements or poor positioning leave her vulnerable to enemy attacks. A single hit means failure, so players must time their actions carefully and strategize to avoid stopping one tile away from an enemy and being struck.

To aid in avoiding damage, Red possesses two replenishable abilities. One ability freezes enemies, temporarily immobilizing them for one turn, providing a momentary reprieve to escape a deadly position. The other ability allows Red to change set a change in direction mid-dash, enabling her to navigate tricky situations. These abilities are limited and can only be replenished by collecting ability pickups scattered throughout the levels, further enhancing the puzzle-like design of the game.

This unique gameplay concept delivers a challenging experience that can best be described as a literal puzzle game disguised as a cyberpunk turn-based hack and slash, seamlessly integrating the puzzle elements into the combat mechanics. After each chapter, the player is scored based on his/her time, killstreaks, and deaths.

While there is a narrative surrounding Red's revenge story, it is not expected to delve deeply into complexity. It serves primarily as a backdrop for Red's relentless pursuit of enemies and progression through levels. I have only played the demo, which included the first level, but the experience has been positive thus far except for some minor visual and animation bugs. For the full version of the game, it is set to include 5 hours of content for the entire story campaign.

Conclusion:

Red Ronin provides players with a puzzle-like gaming experience, utilizing a high-octane turn-based dash and slash concept to simulate and execute the puzzle mechanics. While the game may seem shallow and typical as a turn-based or hack and slash title, it truly shines if you look at it as a puzzle game, offering enjoyable and challenging gameplay. If you're looking for a game that offers a mix of strategy and puzzle-solving, all while seeing cool samurai kills in the process, Red Ronin delivers.
