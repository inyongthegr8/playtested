Vampire Survivors is a 2D survival rogue-lite game that is completely playable with just one hand. Players just need to control the character’s movements, and that’s the whole control scheme of the game. The player character automatically attacks and defends itself against waves of waves of monsters and have to survive as long as they can, usually up to 20 to 30 minutes.

There is no story or background to it and it instead takes the players straight right into the action. Vampire Survivors may seem like an extremely simple game with its retro 2D graphics that look like it came from the NES era but it’s not, it’s deep, engaging, and challenging enough that it can be highly addicting, especially with the low effort required to keep playing. I can effectively classify it as a brain dead game, in a positive manner.

Despite the automated character attacks and 2D top down view, there are still many layers to this game, especially with the many characters, weapons, and item builds that you can try and experiment with. Each of which completely changes how the game plays and ensures not one run is exactly the same.

At the start of a run, players are placed in a level filled with random waves of enemies in increasing difficulty and numbers. Characters start with just their basic weapon and empty item slots. Killing monsters will drop gems that when picked up, will give experience points in order for the character to level up.

Leveling up presents players with three randomized item choices, which boils down to two types: either getting an entirely new item (provided that there is an empty slot) or to upgrade an existing one. Random chests dropped by powerful monsters will also give you random drops of an item or a weapon.

The simple nature of giving players three choices of upgrades every time they level up (characters do level very often in a single run) results in a high permutation of widely different possible builds and combos. Again, providing a lot of versatility, replayability, and progression to the game.

Vampire Survivors’ rogue-lite persistent progression comes in the form of character unlocks and PowerUps, both purchased by gold acquired from playing the game. PowerUps mostly increase a specific stat globally for all runs, like an increased cooldown, speed, or health. It can also introduce some gameplay changes like an extra revive, projectile, or even give themselves a handicap by making the enemies a tad bit harder. Players can re-spec at will so they do not have to worry about choosing the wrong upgrades when starting out.

While the runs of Vampire Survivors get progressively harder by the minute, it still rewards players regardless if they fail because of persistent unlocks and the very prospect of trying out another build, highly motivating them to play more and more runs and getting them addicted to the already gratifying gameplay loop.

Vampire Survivors doesn’t look like a fun game at first sight. People usually get turned off by the retro graphics or the simple gameplay controls, but honestly, it’s much more than it meets the eye. It’s surprisingly addicting and fun, and if you’re going to give any game a chance, this is that game.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
