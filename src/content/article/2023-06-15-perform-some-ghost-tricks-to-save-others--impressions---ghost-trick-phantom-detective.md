Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective has been revitalized with completely HD graphics and flawless animations, breathing new life into its charming world. The game is set to be released on June 30, 2023, but there is a demo on Steam already available for players to try. I was able to play the demo version that allows players to experience the story up to Chapter 2. Notably, any saved data from the demo can be seamlessly transferred to the full version of the game once players purchase it.

The transition to HD graphics in Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is nothing short of breathtaking. Every scene, character, and object is rendered with high level to detail coming from the almost pixelated graphics of the Nintendo DS version, boasting stunning visual fidelity that showcases the game's unique Art Deco cartoonish art style in all its glory. The beautifully designed characters are now fluidly animated instead of being in retro-ish low frame rate, while the environments exude a level of detail that was previously unappreciated.  That being said, the game is still not in full 16:9 screen aspect ratio, rather, it has thick borders on the sides that are used as a UI element for the gameplay.

At its core, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective maintains the same unforgettable gameplay and compelling narrative that made the original game a unique and memorable title. As Sissel, a recently deceased man with a ridiculously tall yellow cone shaped of a hair — now a ghost — with the ability to possess objects and manipulate the physical world. With these powers called “ghost tricks”, players must unravel the mysteries surrounding their own death and save other characters from their impending demise. The intricate environmental and situation puzzles, which require creative thinking and manipulation of the environment to affect its surroundings and change the fate of anyone nearby, remain as engaging and challenging as ever with its time sensitive manner.
