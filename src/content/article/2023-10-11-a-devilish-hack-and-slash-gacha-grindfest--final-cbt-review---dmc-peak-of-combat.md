Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, the long-awaited mobile entry in the iconic Devil May Cry franchise, Promises to bring the same hack-and-slash mayhem to mobile devices but with a somewhat polarizing gacha twist. The game has been through various testing phases and now we are on a final stretch with a final closed beta test.

üìñStory and Narrative Continuity

The game occupies a unique narrative space. Similar to the largely forgotten DmC: Devil May Cry, it exists within its own continuity while revisiting familiar grounds. Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat offers a reimagining of DMC 3, supplemented with elements borrowed from various mainline games, even those set after DMC 3. This narrative approach provides fans with both a sense of nostalgia and novelty. The game features major mainline characters‚ÄîDante, Vergil, Nero, V, and Lady‚Äînow united, equipped with seamless character switching and integrated combo potential. Basically, just forget about the story of the other mainline games and just treat this as its own little pocket of alternate reality.

üé®Visuals and Atmosphere

While the visuals may not push the boundaries of mobile gaming, they certainly land in a decent spot, surpassing the standards set by DMC 3 and aligning with the quality of DMC 4. The atmosphere and feel of the series have been effectively captured, complete with a fitting soundtrack and impactful sound effects, especially for the combos. Character models have adequate detail, and the environments are well-designed, contributing to the game's immersive quality. Even on smaller screens, the visuals maintain fidelity.

‚öîÔ∏èGameplay: Staying True to Its Roots?

When I previewed the game back a few months ago, I touted it as a game that stays true to its roots gameplay wise. Well, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat continues to uphold the core hack-and-slash gameplay style that the series is renowned for. It manages to maintain the essence of the franchise, offering players an opportunity to indulge in the exhilarating combat experience on their mobile devices. The streamlined controls, tailored for mobile, ensure that the transition from consoles to phones is relatively smooth. Players will appreciate the simplicity and accessibility of these controls, which enable precise and responsive movements.

Taking a page from its gacha contemporaries, the game also allows players to seamlessly switch between three characters during combat (e.g. Dante, Nero, and Lady) This mechanic, unchanged from the early preview that I‚Äôve played, encourages creativity and strategy in battles, and enhances the combo system and makes it more dynamic, compensating for the streamlined and simplified touch controlled combat. Not present from my earlier test, there is also now a reaction-based counter system that have been introduced which I haven‚Äôt noticed before, further enhancing the depth and adding more sense of skill to the combat. However, it's not without its flaws, as targeting can be problematic, especially when aiming at airborne units, and controlling the camera during combat is very challenging. It's definitely not the 'Peak of Combat' as far as the Devil May Cry series is concerned.

Interestingly, despite being on a platform known for idle game mechanics, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat does not incorporate an Automatic Mode.  that was featured in the mainline series to make it accessible for more people. This omission feels like a missed opportunity, especially given the game's farming-oriented progression system.

üé∞Gacha Grindfest

Infused within its gameplay is a live service element and a gacha system that is integrated into the progression system. Not everyone will appreciate this change, and, in my opinion, this simple transition fundamentally alters the entire paradigm of the game, and, in my view, not for the better

Players will now encounter features familiar to gacha players, such as login bonuses, weekly events, game modes for grinding resources, premium currency bought with real money, and a stamina system represented as "pizzas," which are required to continue playing the main campaign, and it is not very generous. First hour in and I was already running out of pizzas to play.

I‚Äôve noticed that significant grinding is need required to make progress in the game even as early as the first chapter. This entails acquiring experience points by completing various missions, which also yield materials for enhancing weapons, characters, and statistics. This grind-heavy progression system has a direct impact on combat, as enemies become excessively challenging unless players invest considerable time in grinding or resort to spending real money. The difficulty spikes can be frustrating, potentially deterring players from fully enjoying the combat experience.

üößTechnical Performance

Compared to my earlier test a few months ago, the game as it is now has seen optimization improvements, running much more smoothly on my device with a Snapdragon 888 chipset. These optimizations allowed me to enjoy the game at maximum graphics settings while targeting a stable 60fps, a substantial improvement from the early preview.

The user interface (UI) remains problematic, navigating the UI, there‚Äôs too many clicks need to perform even the simplest of tasks. Whether it's upgrading characters, weapons, ranking up, or even changing weapons and cards, the UI's inefficiency hampered my overall gameplay experience.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is a commendable effort to translate the core elements of the Devil May Cry franchise into the mobile gaming sphere. It captures the essence of the series, both in terms of art and gameplay. The seamless character switching, engaging combat, and mid DMC-looking graphics contribute to an enjoyable gameplay experience. However, the grind-heavy progression centered on its gacha mechanics is what hurts this game the most, especially for DMC fans transitioning from the mainline games to this title. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to try since it‚Äôs going to be free to play, but don‚Äôt expect a smooth skill-based progression that we are used to from the mainline games.
