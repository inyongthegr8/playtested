MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE is a Gacha 6v6 Autobattler game allowing players to engage in strategic battles featuring an array of beloved mobile suits and pilots. With its recent global release, this game is now accessible to fans worldwide.

The game offers an enticing blend of classic Gundam lore and a new narrative that combines animation with engaging battles and adventures. It's possibly a dream come true for fans of the Universal Century timeline, as it brings together various iconic characters and mobile suits in a single mobile game.

The gameplay primarily revolves around assembling squads of mobile suits and pilots, with gacha mechanics playing a crucial role in collecting them. While I found the strategic element to be super simple and borderline an illusion for players, the ability to collect and upgrade different mech suits and pilots is sure to be delight to Gundam fans/

The battles themselves are automated, with the option to activate the EX ability manually --- again, an illusion of choice as it too, can be automated anyway.  As with many mobile games, MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM U.C. ENGAGE incorporates gacha mechanics, which can be enticing but also present a potential pitfall as they are put into separate banners and can be costly to both acquire.

There isn't really much of an "actual" gundam gameplay here. You cannot directly control your Gundam team, the strategic element is a smoke and mirrors at best, and most of the gameplay is centered on the gundam collecting mechanic and experiencing the visual spectacle of the battles. Which honestly, is still a draw on its own especially for Gundam fans. The narrative angle is also a strong suit, as it both features revists and new storylines for the UC timeline.
