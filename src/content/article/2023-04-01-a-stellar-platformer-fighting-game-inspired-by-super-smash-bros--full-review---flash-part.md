Flash Party is a platformer fighting game developed by XD and is released free-to-play for both Android and PC platforms, featuring a gameplay inspired by Super Smash Bros., with its own original characters and live-service element.


**Pros:**


+Console level visuals

+Fun combat

+cross platform play with PC and Mobile


**Cons:**


-Progression system (especially unlocking characters) seemed a little bit grindy

I tried out Flash Party recently, coinciding with the recent update Season 9 and I got to say, after going in blind in playing it, the graphics and gameplay actually wowed me. I am using an old 2018 flagship android phone to play it and the visuals still look crisp and nice with console levels of quality that even looks better than the Switch’s own Super Smash Bros.

Despite being heavily inspired by Nintendo’s Smash Bros, Flash Party features original characters with a stylized cartoonish aesthetic to go along with it. The visuals are actually amazing and the gameplay — mostly pertaining to the combat — was done really well.

The gameplay is very similar to Super Smash Bros. In Flash Party, players get matched up with other players in either 1v1, 2v2, or free for all 4 player matches (either ranked or unranked), and the whole goal of the game is to knock the opposition out of the arena and to deplete their stars by pushing them off the edge of the arena by using various types of attacks.

For newcomers like me, Flash Party is pretty straightforward to learn, with an interactive tutorial that can introduce you to the basics in just a few minutes and get you ready for matches in no time. I mainly played the Mobile version, but I’ve tried the PC version as well and it features an additional “Local Versus” game mode that allows for local shared screen multiplayer.

As for knocking enemies off the map, players can approach this in two ways, by making launching off the map naturally, or by filling up their “damage percentage” to the point that they launch off the map at the slightest touch — damages will build up a percentage meter that affects the throwback effect that character gets, the higher the percentage, the farther the throw.

Players get two kinds of attacks, regular and skill attacks. Each can be performed in four different directions. The touch control scheme is nicely implemented, allowing for swipe gestures with the attack buttons instead of purely relying on movement directions. The jumping is a little bit harder to control, because of the fear of falling, but it doesn’t take long to get used to it.

Speaking of controls, aside from the highly customizable touch controls, Flash Party also features physical controller support, with customizable bindings as well. I’ve personally tested it with my Razer Kishi gamepad, and it works flawlessly. The ability to set bindings is a real game changer that sets this game apart from most mobile games that just offer basic non-customizable controls or none at all.

The combat is a lot of fun, and the mechanic of having to push your enemies off the ledges and edges make for a frantic gameplay action that is a nice change of scenery from the usual health bar mechanic that other fighting games have. The option to team up in 4 player matches also adds a lot to the mayhem and fun factor and allows players to team up with a friend.

Flash Party features a roster of more than 20 characters each with their different movesets, abilities, and cosmetics that you can unlock and purchase. Most of the characters themselves are locked at the start and players can unlock some of them via playing the game or by purchasing some from the hero shop. In addition to the cosmetics, there are also visual effects for KO’s, respawns, and emotes that players can collect. However unlocking characters will take time, and without paying, you’re mostly stuck with the first few characters for quite a while.

These original characters are grouped into four different classes, offering players different ways to fight depending on their preferred playstyle. For example, one focuses on countering shields, another focuses on combos. One focuses on counter-attacks, another focuses on burst attacks.

As part of being a free-to-play live-service offering, Flash Party also frequently releases updates that equate into different Seasons, with the most recent one being Season 9 titled “Wheel of Destiny”. Season 9 adds new sets of skins, a new Dojo system feature (the much awaited clan-like system), along with a new Party Pass for players to conquer.

Season 9 adds new skins for Cupid, Tina, Sophia, Mr. 5, Alice, and Sivi, as well as expanding the game with the aforementioned Dojo feature which allows players and friends to gather in one area, participate in group missions, engage in private chat channels and leaderboards.

Conclusion:

So far, Flash Party has been one of my favorites of all the recent mobile games that I’ve tried. Its fun combat, easy controls, and pleasing visuals make it a stand out among other fighting games. This is a game that I can see myself regularly playing, especially on the go.

It has the potential to be PC and Mobile’s very own Super Smash Bros. especially if it continues to get support and improve. With the recent Season 9 update, this seems like a perfect time to try out this game or come back to it.
