SYNCED is a looter shooter with a gameplay that revolves around players venturing into the semi-open world to clear out increasingly challenging segments that are infested with nano creatures. These missions culminate in intense boss fights that require teamwork, strategy, and coordination when in team-based mode, but the game is also viable when played Solo, such is my experience for the majority of my PvE playthrough.

It takes a lot of inspirations from other genres, mixing rogue-lite elements with its randomized choices of upgrades every run, battle royale mechanics with its semi-open world map in both the PvP and PvE game modes, and even Pokemon style of capturing and commanding powerful Nano creatures.  Of course, it somehow also feels like a zombie survival shooter with how the hordes of Neon creatures are coming right at you.

The graphics wowed me, the game is not only beautiful but also exceptionally well-optimized except for some occasional stutters. I was pleasantly surprised to discover top tier graphics features such as Ray Tracing, DLSS, and even Frame Gen, which significantly enhance the visual experience. The gunplay and overall feel of the combat is equally as wow-ing, delivering responsive controls and a satisfying FPS combat experience. Whether I was facing off against mobs or other players, the combat mechanics provided a thrilling and enjoyable sensation of action and precision..

SYNCED is set as a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but so far everything Iâ€™ve seen are character cosmetics, weapon skins,  or unlocking some of the characters without any pay-to-win mechanics in place, which bodes well for the overall balancing and progression of the game.
