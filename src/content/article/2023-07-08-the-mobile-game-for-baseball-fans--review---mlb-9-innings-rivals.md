MLB 9 Innings Rivals is a brand new mobile game for baseball fans, featuring console level visuals, simple gameplay, fantasy baseball management, and player collecting mechanics.


**Pros:**

+Impressive console level graphics

+Realistic player animation and movements

+Playable in both portrait and landscape


**Cons:**


-landscape game mode only available for matches, not menus

MLB 9 Innings Rivals is a modern follow-up to MLB 9 Innings (currently MLB 9 Innings 23), a game that was originally released way back in 2016. MLB 9 Innings Rivals features significantly improved graphics, new mechanics, and fresh ideas to enhance the addicting player collecting and fantasy baseball gameplay.

As a casual fan with limited knowledge of baseball, I approached MLB 9 Innings Rivals with a sense of curiosity, and boy, I was pleasantly surprised by how fun and easy to understand the game is. Right from the start, you immediately notice the amazing graphics this game has, especially in close-ups and replays when you try the manual play mode. Compared to console games like MLB The Show, this is as close as it gets for mobile devices. It doesn’t dive deeply into the mechanics of baseball, and just assumes the player knows a bit about it. Players completely going in without knowledge of baseball should do a little bit of research beforehand.

The highly detailed graphics perfectly capture the essence of the sport. The player models and stadiums are well-designed and made more immersive by the impressive motion-captured animations for all player movements. The animations are very realistic, dynamic, and make you feel like you're actually watching a real game.

Roster and team wise, MLB 9 Innings Rivals includes all 30 Major League Baseball teams and the season schedule of 2023. This allows players to step into the shoes of any of their favorite teams and experience the thrill of a full season.

Gameplay wise, the actual baseball sports gameplay is very well done. While still somewhat resembling MLB The Show’s game mechanics and UI elements, The whole process is simplified and you’re not really directly controlling every single thing going on, and mostly focused on playing as a batter or a pitcher.

You can approach matches in three ways: Quick Play, which simulates the whole match instantly but requires quick play tickets; Highlight play, which takes you into the game but simulates most of it, only bringing the player in control of being a batter/pitcher a handful of times; Lastly, you can completely play the entirety of the matches in Full Play, which takes a very long time to do, even if you skip most of the presentation scenes.

Playing as a pitcher, you need to select the desired throw type depending on the player, as well as the desired area to throw it in. Playing as a batter—which is definitely the better experience for me—you just need to predict which part of the catch area it will land on and touch the screen at the right timing to successfully hit the ball. The whole process is simplified but very satisfying to perform, especially when trying to hit balls and aiming for a home run.

Outside of the actual sport lies the fantasy baseball aspect of the game, which involves gacha and player collecting mechanics, as well as deck-building elements. As a live-service gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, season passes, materials to upgrade player decks, premium currency, and an energy system called "balls" to continue playing—nothing out of the ordinary. You can also engage in PvP mode, where you are matched with players of similar deck strength. As a free-to-play experience, I find the game highly enjoyable, especially if you have a genuine appreciation for baseball and are just looking to have some decent, high-quality baseball fun on the go.

The game offers flexibility in gameplay modes, allowing you to play in either landscape or portrait mode during matches. This accessibility option is a significant advantage for players who have a preference for a particular orientation. However, it's worth noting that the menus, particularly when managing teams and players, are limited to portrait mode, which can be inconvenient for landscape-oriented players. Having to switch back and forth between orientations during play sessions can disrupt the overall experience.

Conclusion:

MLB 9 Innings Rivals may not provide the depth, immersion, and simulation focused premium gameplay of its console counterparts, but it still caters to fans who are seeking a fun and accessible baseball gaming experience, with an added fantasy baseball aspect to potentially hook them. Its improved graphics, simplified gameplay, and inclusion of real MLB rosters and schedules create an enjoyable mobile game for those looking to engage in some baseball action.
