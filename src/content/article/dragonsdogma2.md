title: Severe Optimization Issues On An Otherwise A Promising Title | Dragon's Dogma II Review
game: Dragon's Dogma II
---

A personal favorite finally gets a long awaited sequel.  
The first Dragon's Dogma was one of my all-time favorite RPGs, especially for its engaging combat and unique mechanics. So when the second game was announced, I was beyond excited, pre-ordering it without hesitation — a very rare move for me. But unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment due to VERY severe optimization issues that made it nearly unplayable. Even after upgrading my aging CPU, FPS drops and frame spikes persisted, forcing me to set the game aside about halfway through the story. The game was shelved for MONTHS. I tried multiple times to return, even resorting to mods like Frame Gen to improve performance, but the mod was crashing until recently, when I finally managed to get a somewhat steady 100+ FPS with minor drops, allowing a smoother experience overall without crashing. So now, here comes the game.

## Pros
- Unique mechanics including the pawn system, allowing creation of a secondary character called a pawn  
- Ability to recruit pawns from other players, offering a form of asynchronous multiplayer  
- Lively companion chatter with dialogue for every occasion, making companions feel alive  
- Satisfying combat featuring monster-climbing mechanics and visually striking animations  
- Diverse combat skills spanning across 10 classes, each fun to play  
- Quest setup encourages player independence and creative problem solving  

## Cons
- Rushed plot with disjointed pacing, underdeveloped characters, and incoherent story arcs  
- Major characters and locations felt underutilized and forgotten mid-story  
- Performance issues with frame drops, clunky animations, and screen-door visual effects  
- Poor shadowing and lighting quality highlight RE Engine limitations in open worlds  
- Hardcore fast travel and checkpoint mechanics causing frustrating progress loss  
- Heavy reliance on mods for improved performance and quality-of-life improvements

The game’s many unique mechanics remain its strongest asset. The pawn system returns with traditional RPG character creation, letting you create your secondary character (pawn) and recruit two other pawns from other players. This asymmetric multiplayer approach adds a lively social element, with companions responding dynamically to the world and events, complete with in-depth chatter that feels surprisingly alive despite repetition.

Combat is probably the best part of the game. The monster-climbing mechanics add epic spectacle, with intense animations and powerful skills across ten classes. Magic and archery combat are well-implemented and genuinely fun.

The quest design gives players a refreshing hands-off approach, encouraging exploration and creative solutions. The freedom to tackle missions in multiple ways or find unconventional workarounds feels empowering and carries over well from the first game.

Unfortunately, the story falters badly. The narrative rushes through its first half, throwing characters and plot points in without proper development or closure. This leads to a fragmented experience where key figures are sidelined and plot threads are dropped or left unexplained. Although the last third picks up, it never reaches the memorable heights one might expect. The soundtrack and surface-level drama hint at depth that the narrative never fully delivers.

Technical shortcomings severely hamper enjoyment. Despite mods like frame generation, the visuals are blurry, with noticeable TAA softness and poor lighting. The RE Engine shows its limits in large open worlds, which is worrying for future titles using it. The game’s fast travel and checkpoint systems also add unnecessary frustration, sometimes causing you to lose hours of progress.

My overall enjoyment relied heavily on mods, online lore reading, nostalgia for the first game, and a bit of buyer’s remorse. At full price, I can’t recommend it, but waiting for significant discounts or a polished edition might be worthwhile.

### Conclusion

Dragon's Dogma II delivers some of the unique mechanics and satisfying combat that made the original great but is weighed down by severe optimization issues, a rushed and disjointed story, and technical shortcomings. Fans of the first game might find enough here to enjoy, but casual players should wait for major fixes or price drops.
