NEW UPDATE

NEW UPDATE

Cat Fantasy has recently rolled out a series of updates to keep players engaged. More specifically, Cat Fantasy has extended its reach by launching a dedicated server for Southeast Asian players. This means that gamers in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines can now enjoy these brand new servers. This change was rolled out last October 27.

After the update, players have received 50 Pathos Crystals and 500 Phantom Coins. Moreover, the ranking rewards from Phantom Training have been adjusted, providing even more incentives for in-game achievements. The game also started a public test realm (PTR) last October 25.

Cat Fantasy is a turn-based gacha RPG that immerses players in a world of catgirls known as Felines. Stepping into the shoes of a newly instated human inspector at StormEye, you are an investigation officer who is also assigned to manage a cafe named Cat of Baker Street. If this game feels familiar, it's worth noting that a version of it is also known as Cat Planet in the China region.


**Pros:**
- Appealing art style and waifu cat girls
- Variety of Game modes, including a Cafe management element
- A refreshing merging-based combat system
- Auto-play and speed-up combat
- Generous progression rates


**Cons:**
- Lengthy cutscenes, cannot skip individual lines of dialogue
- Confusing card design for merge gameplay


üìùNotable points:

These pros and cons are based on Closed Beta Test done by August 2023 and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product

As you lead your own catgirl squad, you'll alternate between the management of cat-cafe life and mysterious investigations involving monsters called anomalies, deranged felines, and evil rabbit dolls‚Äîall while uncovering the truth behind the existence of an alarming number of diseases plaguing the city.

It features cel-shaded graphics and an anime-inspired art style along with a similarly themed soundtrack. The graphics are highly detailed, the animations are fluid, and the catgirl character designs are obviously waifu, but it‚Äôs nothing we‚Äôve not seen before.

The game begins with your character having a dream where in it he‚Äôs already a seasoned inspector, about an impending apocalypse with only 40 minutes remaining before it occurs. However, following a series of unfortunate events within the dream, the character awakens in the present day, on their first day as an inspector. This day is set approximately 136 days before the events of the dream.

At its core, Cat Fantasy employs a turn-based combat system reminiscent of the mechanics found in games like 7 Deadly Sins. Players engage in battles by utilizing a deck of cards representing various attacks and abilities. The unique mechanic here is the ability to merge adjacent cards to form more potent attacks, adding a strategic layer to the combat. This merging mechanic requires players to consider their moves carefully. For those seeking convenience, the game offers an auto-play option, allowing for streamlined combat encounters. Additionally, a speed-up feature of 2x, with 3x accessible through a premium option, caters to players who prefer faster-paced gameplay.

The game's narrative is a prominent aspect, but it might be a double-edged sword for some players. Cat Fantasy boasts an extensive array of cutscenes, both in traditional format and visual novel style. While these cutscenes contribute to the depth of the story, they are very long and drawn out. Without voice acting and some of the dialogue being unskippable on a per line basis, it got a little boring that it compelled me to skip some dialogue scenes completely.

Fortunately, players can read a summarized version of the cutscenes instead, which is a neat feature that‚Äôs getting popular nowadays, albeit it still needs work as some of the sentences are occasionally cut short. There is no voice acting at the moment in the cutscene dialogues, but in gameplay there are voice lines from the characters.

Combat in Cat Fantasy is visually engaging and appealing, with beautiful skill animations ‚Äî especially the special ones ‚Äî adding flair to each attack. However, some players might find certain cards challenging to distinguish from one another due to their very similar designs, which unnecessarily complicates the merging aspect of the gameplay.

Beyond the main story, which spans an impressive number of chapters and missions, there‚Äôs also a plethora of side game modes. These include a Cafe management segment where you're tasked with overseeing menu offerings, staff assignments, catering deliveries, and the progressive enhancement of the Cafe‚Äôs level. Additionally, there are other combat-oriented game modes catered for the purpose of farming specific materials to level up characters and gathering ingredients for crafting potential menu items in the Cafe.

Currently, the game is a bit generous across the board. There is an stamina/energy system designed to limit play, but I was overflowing with it for the first few hours that I played. I also received a lot of gold for general use, and currency for numerous gacha rolls in which I received one SSR early on, and multiple SR characters. While the closed beta test currently underway has gacha and premium currency implemented, the final model of the game remains to be seen. I hope the developers strike a balance that ensures an enjoyable experience for free-to-play players too.

Conclusion:

Cat Fantasy presents an enticing combination of elements, weaving turn-based combat, cafe management, and gacha systems enhanced by alluring waifu catgirl characters. While the story is a bit too heavy and the current lack of voice acting made it unbearable to go through, players can just skip these segments to jump straight into the gacha RPG waifu action.
