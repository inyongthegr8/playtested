Metal Slug: Awakening, the latest addition to the Metal Slug series, combines nostalgia with modern mobile gaming dynamics. While adhering to the classic run-and-gun formula that fans adore, the game introduces a control scheme tailored to touch controls, offering accessibility for players of all levels.  It even includes an auto-target feature.

The upgraded three-dimensional graphics within the familiar side-scrolling perspective adds a visual upgrade that retains the series' charm. Multiple playable characters that fans will love and recognize, diverse weaponry from conventional to outlandish, and engaging rides contribute to wide range of combat scenarios. Aside from the traditional chapter-ized story mode, the inclusion of a variety of game modes like PvP, Coop, and even a roguelite-esque game mode greatly enhances replay value.

Ultimately, the game offers an enticing blend of the beloved Metal Slug formula, new game modes, and modern mobile gaming trends, making it a free-to-play game with in-game purchases and gacha elements. At the end of the day, I think it's worthwhile experience for both long-time fans of the series and even newcomers who have missed out on the classic Metal Slug games.
