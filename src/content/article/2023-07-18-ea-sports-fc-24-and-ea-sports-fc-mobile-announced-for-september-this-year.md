EA Sports has recently unveiled the highly anticipated global launch date for EA Sports FC 24, the new rebranded version of the beloved FIFA series. Football enthusiasts worldwide can mark their calendars for September 29, 2023, as EA Sports FC 24 promises to deliver yet another exhilarating and authentic football gaming experience, powered by EA’s Frostbite engine..

Why the name rebrand?

Following the announcement made on May 10, 2022, EA Sports and FIFA revealed that their long-standing licensing agreement would come to an end on December 31, 2022. However, fans need not worry about the future of their favorite football video game franchise, as EA Sports FC is here to take its place. This new iteration will retain its extensive collection of football licenses, boasting an impressive lineup of over 19,000 players, 700 teams, 100 stadiums, and 30 leagues. EA Sports FC 24 has even more to offer with the addition of prestigious licenses, such as the UEFA Women's Champions League, Spain's Liga F, and Germany's Frauen-Bundesliga.

Mobile version?

Simultaneously, EA is also planning to update its mobile offering with the upcoming release of EA Sports FC Mobile. For existing players of EA Sports FC Mobile, the transition to the new version will be seamless. The game will be available as an update on the App Store or Play Store, allowing players to continue their football journey without losing their progress. Account names will carry over, with more information on the specifics will be shared as we go closer to launch this September.

EA Sports FC Mobile will still include renowned licenses such as the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and many more. As the launch of EA Sports FC 24 and EA Sports FC Mobile draws closer, football fans worldwide are eagerly awaiting the arrival of these highly anticipated games. With their dedication to authenticity, expansive licensing agreements, and a promise to deliver unparalleled gaming experience, EA Sports is set to continue what it has always been doing to the world of football, only with a brand new name.
