DanMachi BATTLE CHRONICLE is a gacha-based ARPG set in the enchanting world of Orario from the "Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?" anime. Players take on the role Bell Cranel and his waifu friends, an ambitious adventurer as he grows from novice to formidable warrior, fueled by his connection to the goddess Hestia. The game's visuals is a faithful reflection of the anime's aesthetics, bringing characters and environments to video game form.

Gameplay within DanMachi BATTLE CHRONICLE revolves around real-time combat, where players engage in dynamic battles against an array of adversaries. The game adopts a popular character-switching system, enabling players to seamlessly alternate between up to three adventurers during battles. Each adventurer possesses distinct skills, strengths, and weaknesses, encouraging strategic team compositions.

Regarding the characters, the game features two sets of character types: Adventurers and an Assist character class. Adventurers are the main combatants of your party, and you can select up to three to seamlessly switch during battles. Each Adventurer has their own set of skills and abilities, as well as strengths and weaknesses against different types of enemies.

In terms of the actual combat, it feels a bit clunky and stiff. The controls were quite unresponsive, particularly when executing abilities and switching characters. Additionally, the absence of a natural target lock or aim assist feature was a very jarring experience. All aiming had to be done manually using the left stick or by standing still.

For newcomers, the game does a decent job of retelling the story, although having some prior knowledge of the anime/manga is still recommended. Gameplay-wise, the tutorial makes the game beginner friendly. The game provides helpful tips and guides, ranging from genuinely informative loading screens to comprehensive training missions that unlock as players progress through the first few hours. As for the gacha rolls, the first one offers free infinite reroll tries, which is perfect for those targeting specific characters and who would normally reset the entire progression manually again and again to get what they want.
