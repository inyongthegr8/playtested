Among Us is an incredibly fun and addicting multiplayer game that challenges your deduction and deception skills. The game is set on a spaceship where players take on the role of either a Crewmate or an Impostor. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete various tasks around the ship, kick out any Impostors; while the Impostors must sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being caught, before all the tasks are complete.

What makes Among Us so exciting is the constant tension between the Crewmates and Impostors. As a Crewmate, you have to keep a close eye on your fellow players and try to figure out who the Impostors are before it's too late. Meanwhile, as an Impostor, you have to use your wits and deception skills to blend in with the Crewmates and carry out your nefarious plans.

One of the best things about Among Us is how easy it is to pick up and play. The game has simple controls and a straightforward gameplay loop, which makes it accessible to players of all skill levels,even non-gamers. However, there is still plenty of depth and strategy to be found in the game, as players learn to read each other's body language, poker faces, truth and lies; and use subtle cues to uncover the Impostors.

Now, in 2023, Among Us is still alive and kicking, with continuous updates that still follow the same formula, only being welcome improvements. A major update in 2021, added optional specialized roles like Engineers that can travel vents, adding to the confusion; Scientists that can keep current vitals of all players, and Guardian Angels that can protect players from getting killed.

A few weeks ago, last December 2022, an alternative Hide n Seek game mode was added. There is only one impostor, its identity revealed, and there are no meetings or ejections. Removing all deduction elements and making this gamemode a full-on hunter and hunted asymmetric survival game.

Among Us also occasionally does collaborations with other franchises that adds new cosmetics to use such as the Spartan Armor from Halo, or character skins from League of Legends. More recently, they have a new collaboration with Destiny 2, adding cool new cosmetics such as Hunter, Warlock, and Titan skins.

In 2023, Among Us is still such a fun, tense experience that only seems to be getting better with modest updates that keeps players interested, even amidst all the eventual release of many games it inspired.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
