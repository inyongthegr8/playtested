Bleak Sword DX
Bleak Sword DX is a pixel art soulslike-roguelite that offers an enhanced version of the original game for PC and Switch, following its initial exclusive release on Apple Arcade.


**Pros:**


+Striking visual style, combining 1-bit aesthetics with modern visuals

+Challenging and satisfying souls-like combat

+Quick and accessible gameplay; short levels and forgiving restarts

+New game modes, controller support, and additional DLC chapters


**Cons:**


-Gets repetitive after a while

-RPG mechanics not as deep

-Limited narrative depth

In Bleak Sword DX, the protagonist is not the one wielding the titular Bleak Sword; rather, they must seek to destroy the weapon itself. As an unnamed warrior, your task is to lift the curse of the legendary Bleak Sword that has plagued the land for over two hundred years. While the story is not that deep, it serves as a premise and backdrop for the hack-and-slash combat action.

As an enhanced PC/Switch version of the Apple Arcade exclusive, Bleak Sword DX introduces several new features that enhance the gameplay and expand the overall experience, mainly adding three new game modes: A randomized campaign run, a boss run only mode, and an arena wave survival mode. Bleak Sword DX also includes all the original chapters from the base game, as well as three additional DLC chapters.

The game's visuals combine a 1-bit aesthetic with modern visual effects, along with a filter that adds a nostalgic touch of old box TVs with distortion effects. The soundtrack complements the black and white ominous atmosphere perfectly, while the sound effects effectively highlight impactful hits, parries, and sword swings.

The gameplay in Bleak Sword DX is straightforward, with levels each comprising singular blocks and grouped into 12 chapters. Players must clear each level of monsters and survive waves of enemies. The levels are relatively short, ranging from a few seconds in the early stages to a few minutes in the more challenging ones.

What sets this game apart from most roguelikes is that you don't have to start from scratch if you die. Instead, you can immediately jump back into the level without feeling frustrated or having lost significant progress. The only roguelite element is that if you die, you are given one last chance to repeat that level; otherwise, you lose any items and XP acquired thus far. Each chapter concludes with a boss encounter that presents a fair challenge, even on the first attempt, without feeling unbalanced or overly frustrating.

Combat in Bleak Sword DX revolves around kinetic gameplay mechanics and features systems such as dodging, blocking, and parrying, along with a stamina system that is consumed with attacks (but not dodges, making them slightly overpowered). The controls are responsive, and the parrying system is forgiving, striking a satisfying balance. Despite the dodge and parry mechanics feeling a bit overpowered, the enemies' diverse characteristics and attack patterns prevent the combat from becoming monotonous. Some enemies strike quickly, while others require multiple hits to defeat or execute powerful attack combos.

Aside from combat, the player also earns XP over time and levels up, resulting in increased stats. They are given the choice to increase health, defense, or attack. Additionally, the player discovers and collects equipable items and consumables to enhance their journey. However, the overall system feels simplistic and lacks depth, as it doesn't provide ample avenues for customization.

The game disappointingly limits players to only two item slots, restricting their ability to fully personalize their playstyle compared to full body itemization in other RPG games. Nonetheless, the progression system adds a sense of growth and development to the otherwise repetitive gameplay. The gradual increase in power is noticeable, as for example, enemies that initially required 4 hits to defeat now succumb to just 2 hits. The player also gains noticeable improved durability, allowing them to withstand more damage than before.

While the gameplay loop may become repetitive over time, the challenging hack-and-slash nature of Bleak Sword DX keeps players on their toes and engaged. The core concept revolves around clearing one level and moving on to the next, employing a combination of dodging, parrying, and slashing. There is a slight change in how the game plays in one particular level where players ride a horse, navigating obstacles and eliminating enemies along the way, but otherwise it is a pretty consistent experience from start to end.

Conclusion:

Bleak Sword DX delivers a visually captivating and atmospheric soulslike-roguelite experience. Its unique visual style, complemented by an exceptional soundtrack, creates a memorable ambiance. The challenging yet rewarding combat mechanics, along with the ability to continue from the same level after death, provides a solid well rounded difficulty. While the gameplay may become repetitive over time, the engaging combat and occasional enemy variations keep players invested. If you're a fan of soulslike combat and enjoy atmospheric pixel art aesthetics, Bleak Sword DX is one such game that is well worth a try.
