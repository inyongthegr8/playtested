XCUTE(me) is a vertical shoot’em up featuring sexy female characters for both the heroes and the villains. Players can choose from a collection of four different executer-class “XCUTE” fighter ships with their own different types of shooting pattern, piloted by four different cute female fighters.

The gameplay is simple and can be playable with mostly one finger, occasionally two. Hold the screen to continuously fire and lift your finger to change projectile colors. Avoid all projectiles at all costs.

Matching the gun color to the enemy color will give more points, providing a sort of added challenge to the players instead of purely focusing on pure destruction. When the energy meter is full, two finger taps will release a powerful special move.

I found the gameplay fun and entertaining especially when you’re just amped by the absolutely metal soundtrack that caught me off guard and stole the show. Superbly adding an intense and exhilarating vibe to the game.

The soundtrack and gameplay go hand-in-hand and creates a dazzling experience of bullet hell mayhem that is forgiving to the player. Despite all the carnage, I somehow was able to survive and stay alive many times. Your fighter’s hitboxes are teeny-tiny; it’s just a single dot in the center of the fighter. This allows you to squeeze and “clip” your fighter into the smallest of openings and come out completely unscathed.

All in all, XCUTE(me) shouldn’t take you more than half a day of playing to complete, but its replayability is highly dependent on how you like the gameplay and how you like to replay the five stages. At a reasonable price of $5, It’s not asking much for a try, especially for shoot 'em up aficionados.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
