I recently had the pleasure of exploring ParaSpace, an avatar-based online virtual platform that offers a plethora of immersive experiences and endless opportunities for connection and creativity. It is currently conducting an Android Beta Test right now exclusively available here on TapTap, with a special partnership content ‘TapTap world’ coming soon for TapTap users to chill around and relax in.

I was able to try out TapTap’s own world within ParaSpace, which will officially open once the game is officially released. It is an underground digital obstacle course that ascends towards the surface, where you are congratulated by TapTap at the end. Currently, it's a bit of a blank slate in this beta build, but I am certain that once the game is released and the world becomes freely accessible to players, TapTap fans will undoubtedly fill this world with content and possibly even new mini-games.

Even in its beta state, I found the community to be already welcoming, diverse, and thriving, with well populated rooms and an active player base. In addition to animated emotes, the ability to freely control your hands, presumably to wave, adds an extra layer of immersion to the social interactions — taking a page out of VR games, allowing for non-verbal communication that enhances the overall experience.

ParaSpace has extensive customization options and encourages creating content for the platform, even characters and levels from other franchises. I could personalize my avatar to reflect my unique style, experimenting with different outfits, accessories, and appearances. The level of freedom and creativity in avatar customization is amazing, ensuring that every user can choose or even customly create a representation that feels authentic to their personalities.

ParaSpace also allows abled players to create and share their own avatars and worlds, contributing to the ever-growing library of content available to the community. This fosters a sense of collaboration, as users can integrate others' creations into their own worlds, expanding the possibilities and fostering a vibrant ecosystem of creativity.
