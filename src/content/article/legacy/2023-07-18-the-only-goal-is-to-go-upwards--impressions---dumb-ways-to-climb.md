Dumb Ways to Climb is a platforming game where the only goal is to go upwards. As a bean-like character ripped straight from the cartoon series Dumb Ways to Die, you must climb up a random mishmash contraption of worldly objects, with the sole objective being to reach higher heights, similar to the recent popular game Only Up!. It’s quite obvious that the gameplay concept has been shamelessly borrowed from the aforementioned game, only this time, Dumb Ways to Climb was made specifically for Android and iOS platform.

Dumb Ways to Climb features no main menus, no settings, and just straight up starts the platforming run right upon launch. One might consider this a no-nonsense approach, but that didn’t feel right because this game is actually full of nonsense, for better or for worse.

As a platformer, I cannot deny that Dumb Ways to Climb does provide a nerve-racking experience. The slow ascent through the nonsensical contraptions can be exhilarating, as a single misstep can send you tumbling back to the bottom, requiring a restart. The levels overall, while in the same ballpark as Only Up! with terms of being an insane random collection of objects and structures, felt significantly more uninspired and lack creativity. It felt like this game was hastily created to capitalize on the viral popularity of Only Up!.

Interestingly, Dumb Ways to Climb was developed by PlaySide Studios Ltd, the same developers who created the official Dumb Ways to Die mobile games and hold the rights to the franchise. Despite being the owners of the intellectual property and actually coming out with some pretty cool mobile games previously, this particular game may not live up to the quality and creativity expected from the series.
