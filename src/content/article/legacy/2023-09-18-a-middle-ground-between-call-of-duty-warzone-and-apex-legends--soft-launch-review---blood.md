Gameplay

Blood Strike is a fast-paced battle royale FPS designed with high-octane action in mind. It draws inspiration from popular titles like COD: Warzone and Apex Legends and aims to provide an engaging experience while also prioritizing optimization for lower-end devices. Remarkably, the game maintains a compact installation size, occupying only roughly 1GB.

The game was recently soft-launched in Brazil for Android devices on September 15th, 2023, in an invite-only state. Notably, the game isn't strictly region-locked; anyone with an invite code can access it without the need for a VPN. Alternatively, players can choose to overcome in-game challenges for a chance to gain access. Want an access code? Continue reading this review and you‚Äôll find the codes hidden somewhere.

## üì∫Graphics and Performance


## üì∫Graphics and Performance

The graphics of Blood Strike is a bit of a mixed bag. While specific elements, such as character models and textures, are detailed and good looking enough, the overall visual fidelity leans toward simplicity. This choice isn‚Äôt surprising though, it's probably to accommodate a wide range of devices. However, the performance and general polish still requires further optimization and has plenty of room for improvement. While it offers support for high frame rates, I found that it didn't run as smoothly as some of the visually superior battle royale games on my Snapdragon 888 device.

One gripe though, the game is aggressively asking for your storage permissions for screenshot purposes,. You can decline it, but there is no way to disable these prompts that will appear every few seconds until you finally agree to it. So beware.


## üéÆGameplay and Progression


## üéÆGameplay and Progression

The gameplay mechanics in Blood Strike closely resemble the conventional battle royale format, pitting up to 100 players against each other in an expansive map featuring diverse biomes. Players are tasked with scavenging for in-match cash, weapons, armor, and supplies. The current map design offers ample space for exploration, vehicular use, and intense player encounters. Presently, the game allows solo play or teaming up in squads of four.

An intriguing feature of Blood Strike is its cash system, which allows players to request loadout drops after completing specific tasks. These drops provide access to rare weapons and equipment, enhancing a player's competitive advantage.

As for accessibility and the streamlining of gameplay experience, it offers one of the best systems that I‚Äôve seen in mobile battle royale games. For starters, the aim assist is very strong in this one. Almost console-like in terms of snapping into enemies even far away, simplifying aiming and eliminating adversaries. Not everyone may appreciate this kind of aim-assist feature, but this dynamic not only enhances action-packed gameplay but also places a strong emphasis on reflexes and tactical positioning. To further accommodate the game's fast-paced nature, Blood Strike introduces a lenient respawn system. Players have the opportunity to re-enter the game even after elimination, granted that their teammate remains alive once the respawn timer concludes.

Blood Strike introduces a roster of nine characters called Strikers, with five initially unlocked. Each Striker possesses unique active and passive abilities, contributing to diverse gameplay experiences. For example, Kraken is focused on utility and combat, E.M.T is focused on healing teammates, Val focuses on Reconnaissance, while Jet focuses on high damage output via grenades and artillery.

Progression relies on a Merit-based system, allowing players to unlock weapon attachments and cosmetics by consistently using these specific weapons. Additionally, players can customize their initial loadout, reducing dependence on RNG and looting. The in-game currency system allows for the purchase of items from vending machines around the map, further enhancing player customization.

I personally have not played any of the earlier test iterations of this game. However, reports suggest that there have been significant changes compared to previous test versions. It appears that the game has undergone substantial evolution throughout its ongoing development. Many features and aspects of the game were entirely reworked, bearing little resemblance to their original gameplay style. However, as we near its official launch, it seems that this current version of the game represents its final form, as even progression during this soft launch will carry over to the official release.

Blood Strike is set to use a free-to-play model, including the introduction of premium currency and gacha mechanics. These elements enable players to obtain cosmetic items, weapons, and unlock the rest of the Strikers. There are no stamina system in place, so players can play to their heart's content. There is a bit of a pay-to-win element because you can acquire new weapons using real money or in-game currency, but ultimately, it all boils down to player skill in combat situations.


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Blood Strike presents itself as a compelling addition to the battle royale genre, borrowing elements from established titles while prioritizing accessibility for a wider range of devices. The graphics, while not groundbreaking, serve their intended purpose. The game's strong aim-assist insures a fast-paced gameplay easily accessible to many players. This game is probably the perfect alternative to the still unreleased Call of Duty: Warzone and can also fill the void left by the surprising shutdown of Apex Legends Mobile last May.
