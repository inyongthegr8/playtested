If you have played twin-stick shooters and retro pixel-style rogue-lites, then Metal Mind  should feel familiar you, The gameplay mechanics of Metal Mind follow a classic twin-stick shooter formula, but with a twist. It’s actually a “single-stick” shooter because aiming is already done automatically. You just have to fire the weapon, or activate abilities.

Character movement is controlled using the left stick, and shooting, dodging, and ability with the right part of the screen. Because of the auto-aim mechanic, the controls feel really responsive and right at home as a casual mobile rogue-lite experience. Of course, this comes at a strategic cost of not being able to manually aim at enemies.

The game mechanics are actually decent for a rogue-lite, encouraging experimentation and freedom to swap out parts. As you progress through the game's ever-changing map and clear room after room, the player is presented with upgrade pickups that can change the mech’s actual body part. Swap your mech parts out for different bonuses and purposes, or if perhaps you simply just like the looks.

The core gameplay loop in Metal Mind is undeniably enjoyable and addictive. With a plethora of unlockable guns, quirky robot appendages, customizable load-outs, skill synergies, secrets, challenging enemies, and charismatic characters, the game offers a wealth of content to keep players engaged. However, it's worth noting that there are some minor bugs, although nothing that breaks the overall experience.
