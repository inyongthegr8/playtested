Immortal Kingdoms M Playpark
9.2
Pre-register


## ‚ú®Overview
Immortal Kingdoms is an upcoming fantasy MMORPG for both mobile and PC. The game promises a variety of gameplay mechanics, including solid idle RPG features that allows players to automate many aspects of the game, as well as traditional MMORPG elements such as PvP, PvE, character progression, and customization.

The game is not out yet, but I had the opportunity to explore the game this past weekend in a closed internal testing phase, and this is indeed an interesting game to discuss when it comes to its progression and idle game features. The two versions I‚Äôve played are under Indonesian localization and English localization. For players interested in this game, Pre-registration is currently live and on-going on Google Play, and a beta test will probably be announced very soon.


## üìñStory and Premise
The game is set in a world ravaged by war between kingdoms, and there is really cool CGI at the start of the game showcasing the characters in action to set the mood. However, beyond that, the game understandably isn‚Äôt really heavy on the narrative, especially with its focus on Idle gaming (It‚Äôs pointless to have a rich story if everybody plays in idle anyway). The game features medieval fantasy elements such as swords, magic, monsters, interweaved with the use of guns (gunpowder fantasy).


## üé®Visuals and Art
Immortal Kingdoms features detailed character models and vibrant open environments. However, its art design and color palette give it a standard MMORPG appearance, reminiscent of games like World of Warcraft or Tarisland, nothing too fancy. The character models, particularly the female characters, have doll-like appearances rather than a more anime or realistic style, which is a bit unusual for me. Overall though, I would say the graphics are on par with leading MMORPG games, offering a visually stunning experience, so far as graphics go, it isn‚Äôt lacking.


## üéÆGameplay
Immortal Kingdoms offers a blend of traditional MMORPG elements with an idle RPG format, providing players with diverse gameplay options. The game allows for automated navigation, combat, and farming, making it essentially a large idle RPG within an MMORPG format. Players can choose to automate almost everything in the game, including quests, weapon equipping, and skill activation, allowing for a more relaxed gameplay experience. The game also features a variety of multiplayer options, including both PvP and PvE modes, where players can team up with friends or compete against each other in exciting battles.

There are five classes to choose from when creating a character in Immortal Kingdoms: Reaper, Slayer, Assassin, Sorcerer, and Gunslinger. Some classes have two genders, while others are locked to one gender. You can customize it‚Äôs appearance including its facial features, sizes, colors, and hair styles.

The Reaper is a fearsome class that wields a scythe and possesses the ability to manipulate life and death. The Slayer is a stalwart class known for their resilience and strength on the battlefield, clad in heavy armor and wielding powerful weapons to excel at absorbing damage and protecting their allies.

The Assassin is a master of stealth and deception, specializing in quick and lethal strikes. The Sorcerer is a spellcaster who harnesses the power of magic to unleash devastating attacks. The Gunslinger is a skilled marksman who specializes in a wide range of firearms, essentially making the game a gunpowder fantasy. They are deadly accurate with their shots and can take down enemies from a distance.


## ‚öîÔ∏èCombat
The combat in Immortal Kingdoms follows a typical third-person ARPG format, with real-time combat, skill activation, dodging, and enemy avoidance. While the combat system offers some depth, including the ability to activate skills and perform combos, it may feel repetitive to some players, especially during automated gameplay. Movement is a bit clunky too, which can be frustrating during intense combat situations


## üïπTo Idle or To not Idle?
Although the idle gameplay is the main draw, as you can still play the game and control your character as usual, moving the character manually and participating in combat by activating skills yourself. I see some faint semblance to the Souls-like genre in terms of how it plays, but only to a small extent. However, you are really doing yourself a disservice if you ever opt to play this in full manual mode all throughout. I strongly advise playing this game as an idle RPG, with only occasional control of your character if you want to experience some action yourself and experience your characters current power levels from time to time.


## ‚è´Progression and Monetization
The progression system in Immortal Kingdoms is based on quick incremental upgrades and level-ups, providing players with a sense of constant progression and reward. However, the game is also heavy on the grind, requiring players to invest time and effort to get stronger.

But then again, the game bombards you with a dose of overwhelming progression mechanics that fill your senses with dopamine, thanks to all the quick incremental upgrades and level-ups throughout the game, creating a sense of continuous advancement. It‚Äôs essentially the same concept as power creep but applied to the game‚Äôs overall progression mechanics. There‚Äôs also lots of boss fights, but these can also be automated/idled as long as your player is powerful enough.

The game is entirely free-to-play but there will be microtransactions and the game will undeniably pressure you to spend money to make your characters more powerful. However, since the game is still in internal testing, details about its monetization model are not yet final.


## üìäTechnical Performance
The game ran pretty well on my Snapdragon 888 device. I just set the graphics to High, FPS to default, and it ran pretty much without problems aside from usual server connectivity issues. As highlighted earlier, the game features a plethora of automation features that basically makes this game an idle RPG that can be play by itself. Although mechanically, it honestly feels early in development in all aspects. It's only in an internal testing phase as of now, so I guess it's acceptable.


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
Immortal Kingdoms has integrated idle RPG mechanics into the traditional MMORPG format and the end result is a fun MMO that doesn‚Äôt take much effort (or no effort at all) to play and experience. The game's idle features allow players to conveniently automate many aspects of gameplay, such as navigation, combat, and farming, while still maintaining a sense of progression and accomplishment. If you love MMOs and Idle gaming, and this game is worth checking out.
