‚ú®Overview
Lost Potato: Premium is an upcoming top-down roguelite set to release on Android and iOS in March 2024. The game offers a distinctive twist on combat mechanics, not allowing players to damage enemies directly but instead requiring the use of other contraptions. It challenges players to survive a jungle filled with man-eating tribes as a young potato. For those wondering, yes, it is made by the same makers of the excellent rogue-lite Brotato (hence the Potato theme).

The game is set to release on Android and iOS this year, expected in March, with a Closed Beta Test scheduled for Android on Feb 28 as a TapTap Exclusive. I'm fortunate enough to have been given early access to the game, allowing me to provide a preview of what it's like.


**Pros:**
- Unique combat mechanic wherein you cannot directly damage enemies
- Charming art style
- Lightweight and runs smoothly on most phones
- Fast-paced and bite sized gameplay



**Cons:**


-Lack of depth and content
-Lack of proper instructions and tooltips and tries too hard to be minimalistic only to become confusing
-Unfairly spawns the player in tight spots sometimes

‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 6/10

üé®Visuals and Art
Lost Potato: Premium shares that distinctive look of Brotato, featuring a charming and clean cartoonish 2D art style that is reminiscent of classic flash games of the 2000s. The graphics are simple yet effective, with clean color palettes and cartoonish character designs that add to the game's charm. Thanks to its lightweight visuals, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that this game will definitely run on almost every smartphone out there.

üéÆGameplay
The gameplay in Lost Potato: Premium revolves around environmental interactions and strategic thinking. Players cannot damage enemies directly with the swing of their weapon, and they must use bouncing, reflecting, and activating bullets/traps to eliminate enemies, with various environmental hazards like rotating spikes, ground spikes, and ball-spewing plants for the player to use. Each encounter presents a unique challenge, requiring players to think on their feet and adapt to the ever-changing environment.

Each level gets progressively harder, and every now and then you get to pick what traps or bonuses you want to add to your arsenal. You die, you restart back to level 1. As part of the persistent progression, players can unlock 14 ‚Äòhats‚Äô, each providing new starting stats or traps, allowing for different playstyles and strategies like an additional starting health or an added focus on a certain trap. Runs take as little as a few seconds to a few  minutes only, making it easy to pick up and play on the go. The game also features randomly generated levels and upgrades, so there is a bit of replayability.

However, there's not much content in the game, and you'll likely see everything you want to see within an hour of play. However, this doesn't mean it's only worth an hour of playtime. It all comes down to whether you find the gameplay loop fun, challenging, and entertaining. Personally, I find the game lacking and has failed to sustain my interest to more than an hour of play. There is simply not much depth aside from unlocking and choosing other ‚Äòhats‚Äô that affect starting stats/traps.

I also have a problem with how the game spawns you in tight spots at the start of levels, giving you only a few seconds to position yourself properly. It's hard to spot your character, so sometimes the time is not enough, resulting in situations where they take damage unfairly or without proper preparation.

The game also lacks instructions and proper tooltips to explain the mechanics. While I appreciate the attempt to be minimalistic by only showing things visually with icons, it just doesn‚Äôt work here and it confused me.

Still, I had fun while it lasted, especially when testing out different traps and trying out the best strategy on how to win. My favorite moment is probably whenever you deflect bullets, where it can somewhat make you feel like a Jedi deflecting blaster fire.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
Despite its engaging gameplay loop and unique ‚Äúkill enemies indirectly‚Äù mechanics, Lost Potato: Premium falls short in terms of depth and content. Players may find themselves experiencing everything the game has to offer within a short time, leading to a lack of long-term engagement. For $2 though, it‚Äôs hard to complain, so if you‚Äôre looking for a cheap game for a quick hour or two of enjoyment, then perhaps Lost Potato: Premium might still satisfy your craving.
