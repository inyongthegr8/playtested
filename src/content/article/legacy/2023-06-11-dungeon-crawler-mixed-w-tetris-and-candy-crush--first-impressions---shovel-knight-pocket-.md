Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is an engaging and addictive roguelike dungeon crawler puzzle available on Switch, PC, and with a Netflix exclusive port for Android and iOS. It draws inspiration from retro-style 2D platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. With its pixelated art style and charming graphics, the game pays homage to classic video games.

The core gameplay of Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon combines elements of three-match puzzle mechanics and Tetris style falling blocks, with dungeon crawling, resulting in a unique puzzle RPG experience. Players take control of Shovel Knight or nine other playable characters with their own abilities, navigating them on an 8x8 grid where they can move up, down, left or right. As enemies and blocks descend from above and fill the grid, players must strategically move and attack to clear them. Failure to defeat an enemy results in the player receiving damage equivalent to the enemy's offensive strength. Movement by one unit instantly drops the blocks downward, while choosing not to move causes the blocks to descend slowly.

Groups of enemies can be cleared simultaneously, a mechanic called "chaining," when they are connected with each other, resembling match-three puzzle clearing elements like Candy Crush. These enemies come in various shapes and sizes, with some being straightforward and having fixed health and damage values, while others pose more challenging encounters. Certain enemies deploy shields in the direction of the initial attack, necessitating attacks from different angles, while some enemies require precise timing to avoid devastating counter-attacks.

In addition to enemies and blocks, various elements such as keys and bombs fall from above. Keys are essential for opening chests and doorways, while bombs clear a significant portion of the surrounding area. The game also incorporates helpful items that enhance Shovel Knight's abilities, such as a spear that extends his attack range or a weapon that freezes enemies in place. These items can be obtained through in-game shops using gems earned during runs. The shops offer both persistent upgrades in the camp shop and temporary boosts in the in-run shops.

Initially, the game presents a challenging experience, with limited health and damage points. However, the game offers high customizability regarding the game parameters, allowing players to adjust their character's base health, damage, and other important aspects to tailor the gameplay to their preferences. This flexibility ensures that players can enjoy the game according to their desired level of difficulty.
