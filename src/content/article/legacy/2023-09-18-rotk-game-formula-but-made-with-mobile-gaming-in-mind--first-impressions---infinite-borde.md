Infinite Borders is an engaging strategy game that transports players to the heart of the Three Kingdoms period. You'll have the chance to align yourself with legendary heroes, conquer new lands, and wage epic battles against formidable foes.

The Closed Beta Test for Infinite Borders runs from September 15th to September 30th and covers three major regions: Asia, North America, and Europe. While the game has been available in East Asia regions like China, Thailand, and Vietnam under the title "Reign of Warlords" or "ROW: Tam Quá»‘c" for a few years now, it's now making its mark on a global scale.

Infinite Borders combines the romanticized events of The Three Kingdoms era with RPG city-building mechanics and gacha elements. As a player, you'll construct and upgrade buildings within your city, managing resources like wood, iron, and stone. The game offers over 300 heroes with diverse skills, and caters to many playstyles; either you just want to build your city, or maybe conquer neighboring territories, or perhaps ally with other kingdoms. It's all possible in this game.

While some rough edges and English localization issues may exist for now, they don't overshadow the game's potential for enjoyment - because it IS quite addicting. Of course, this comes at the cost of colossal real-life wait times for things such as building construction, castle upgrades, army training, and troop marching, unless you spend money to speed up the progression.
