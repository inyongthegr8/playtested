Lost in Play is a puzzle adventure game that features hand-drawn, cartoonish visuals that are visually pleasing and perfectly complement the game's playful atmosphere.

Lost in Play combines adventure and puzzle-solving elements to create an engaging gameplay experience. Players assume the roles of Toto and Gal, guiding them through various dreamscapes and challenging puzzles. The puzzles range from classic point-and-click environmental puzzles to interactive "in-your-screen" puzzles.

The puzzle design is thoughtful and well-balanced, offering a variety of challenges that cater to different types of thinking. Whether it's figuring out the right sequence of actions to progress or solving mechanical puzzles within the game world, players will find themselves engrossed in the gameplay.

My favorite aspect of Lost in Play is the hint system. At any point in the game, players can access hints represented by simple illustrations or drawings. These hints provide a nudge in the right direction without giving away the entire solution.

I was only able to play the demo, which free to try for both Android and iOS, but so far so good! If the game feels familiar to you, the game was developed and released initially for the Nintendo Switch and PC platforms, but has now made its way to Android and iOS devices just this July
