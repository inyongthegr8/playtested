Lost in Play is a charming adventure game that takes players on a whimsical journey alongside two siblings, Toto and Gal. Developed initially for the Nintendo Switch and PC platforms, it has now made its way to Android and iOS devices just this July, and I was able to play the free demo of this game for Android.

Lost in Play features hand-drawn, cartoonish visuals that are visually pleasing and perfectly complement the game's playful atmosphere. While inspired by classic cartoons, the graphics are somewhat modernized and polished, creating a vibrant and colorful world. The characters' stylish design, vivid dreamscapes, and imaginative creatures all contribute to the game's whimsical universe. The art style is pleasing to the eyes, and would definitely be a draw for kids but not necessarily for them only, you could tell that the developers put a lot of effort in it as an artwork.

The accompanying soundtrack is equally enchanting, with music that seamlessly blends fantasy and mystery. While there is no dialogue, the characters communicate through gibberish sounds, reminiscent of The Sims, which adds a touch of whimsy to their interactions and adds an extra playful nature as opposed to if it were a completely silent game, or a fully voiced one. Despite the lack of dialogue, the characters' gibberish sounds effectively convey their thoughts and feelings, fostering a sense of connection between players and the adorable protagonists.

Lost in Play combines adventure and puzzle-solving elements to create an engaging gameplay experience. Players assume the roles of Toto and Gal, guiding them through various dreamscapes and challenging puzzles. The puzzles range from classic point-and-click environmental puzzles to interactive "in-your-screen" puzzles.

The puzzle design is thoughtful and well-balanced, offering a variety of challenges that cater to different types of thinking. Whether it's figuring out the right sequence of actions to progress or solving mechanical puzzles within the game world, players will find themselves engrossed in the gameplay. The puzzles are designed to be accessible to players of all ages, striking a balance between being challenging yet solvable. Sometimes you are tasked to solve a variety of puzzles, like beating someone in a checkers match, or perhaps solving the gears of an alarm clock to make it work.

My favorite aspect of Lost in Play is the hint system. At any point in the game, players can access hints represented by simple illustrations or drawings. These hints provide a nudge in the right direction without giving away the entire solution. It's a helpful feature that ensures players, both children and adults alike, can progress even if they find themselves stuck.

Lost in Play's story revolves around the sibling duo of Toto and Gal. The game starts with the player controlling Gal, who must find creative ways to capture her brother's attention and spark his imagination. Once Toto's interest is piqued, the whimsical adventure takes flight. While the story may not be elaborate or even sensical, it serves as a backdrop for the playful exploration and puzzle-solving that awaits.

With its beautiful cartoon art, captivating puzzles, and delightful narrative, Lost in Play offers a feel-good experience suitable for players of all ages. Its captivating visuals, enchanting soundtrack, and well-crafted puzzles make for an immersive and enjoyable experience, if the full game is anything like the Demo experience, and this game is surely worth a buy! Ofcourse, you can try the demo for free first.
