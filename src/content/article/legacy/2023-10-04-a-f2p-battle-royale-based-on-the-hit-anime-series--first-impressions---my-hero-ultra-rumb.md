Right from the start, MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE immerses you in the world of Heroes and Quirks, and it's exhilarating. The game is action-packed and really captures the vibe of the anime so well in its battles and combat, delivering an authentic anime gaming experience in battle royale format.

While the controls are generally responsive, I did notice that there's a learning curve, especially when playing with a keyboard and mouse. With multiple controls than usual for abilities, dodging, and items, it takes a bit of time to get used to the layout.

The free-to-play model is fair, and in-game purchases are not overly intrusive. The ability to earn most characters through gameplay is a plus, and the premium battle pass can be unlocked without spending real money.

Currently, the battle royale market is still saturated, so this will need some serious updates to survive. Unfortunately,  the game  having no crossplay doesn't help, despite the game being available on PC, Xbox, PS, and Switch, this means the playerbase is automatically splintered.

While the initial impressions are positive, there's plenty of room for improvement. I found ultra chaotic nature of the battles overwhelming and annoying, and certain character abilities might need balancing. (stun-locks and huge AOEs). Also, I hope the fair F2P model is maintained, and crossplay support is added in the future.
