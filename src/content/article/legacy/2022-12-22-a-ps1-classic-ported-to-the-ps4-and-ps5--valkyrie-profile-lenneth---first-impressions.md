Valkyrie Profile has come a long way from its PS1 origins, its PSP re-release the Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the recent mobile ports, to now its modern PS4 and PS5 release.

While there are multiple playable characters and party members in Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, you primarily control Lenneth, the primary protagonist and a lady warrior serving Odin, tasked with recruiting the Einherjar — fallen heroes who have died in battle — to fight in the impending Ragnarok. Concepts in which we all are too familiar with recent Norse mythology games like God of War, Assassin’s Creed, and even Valheim, coming out recently.

Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth has a very gripping and emotional story, one that deals with loss and despair, as well as hope and redemption. Since you are recruiting the Einherjar, all the characters you are trying to recruit need to have died in battle. Before they are recruited, the game shows you a short glimpse of the character’s life leading to their death.

Failed heroes, betrayal, suicide, bad luck, and whole lot of other rather depressing topics are tackled in the story, if this still isn’t obvious, this game is not for the faint hearted.

Most of the voice acting plus the heavily pixelated graphics hasn’t aged well by today’s standards, but it's not a big deal considering the amazing story and highly engaging gameplay you are offered.

Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is divided into three core gameplay element. The 3D world-map where Lenneth flies over to choose where to go. The 2D dungeon platforming exploration, and the unique turn-based combat where both sides attack simultaneously during their turn.

The combat is highly engaging and surprisingly kinetic despite the turn based system. The simultaneous attack per party turn system works really well. It encourages synergistic combos between the different characters and reduces dull “strategic” moments in between attacks or turns. Each turn, there is a special meter that fills with each attack, and if filled in one turn — thanks to a great combo — it culminates in a special attack for anyone that participated in building it.

Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth for the Playstation 4 and 5 is basically the same PS1 game that fans know and love. For newcomers, this is one of the best PS1 games of all time. And It largely holds up thanks to its impressive storytelling and unique gameplay still relevant to this day thanks to the continued use of turn-based combat mechanics by the gaming industry.
