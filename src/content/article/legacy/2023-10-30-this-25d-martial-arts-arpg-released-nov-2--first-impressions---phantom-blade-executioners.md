Phantom Blade: Executioners is a cross-platform martial arts action RPG developed by S-Game, available on PC, PlayStation, Android, and iOS. With a release date set for November 2, 2023, the game offers full cross play functionality, allowing players to engage in fast-paced combat across different platforms, entirely free-to-play.

Players can choose from four unique characters, each with distinct abilities and fighting styles, including a swordsman, heavy swordsman, agile swordswoman, and ranged support hero. All four characters have separate progression and uses their own stamina system, so you can basically cycle through four characters to basically quadruple the allowed playtime.

The 2.D brawler/hack and slash style combat is fast-paced, action-packed, and players can utilize two-button abilities, dodge/roll, jump, and parry/block actions to defeat enemies. The game encourages the creation of skill chains and combos for strategic and powerful combat. no need to memorize combos or have lightning fast reflexes, just customize your combo beforehand and activate it with a single tap.

Since the characters are fixed, the Gacha system instead is all about obtaining and attaching Phantoms to your Skills. Phantoms are basically spirits or avatars that are activated when you use that skill attached to it. You can attach any Phantom to any skill, and customize your combos even further. The combat is cool and promising, but If ound that the 2.5D model clashes with it and makes the combat feel floaty and unresponsive.

The free-to-play game releases soon on November 2, for a variety of multi platforms (PC, PlayStation, Android, and iOS) and it's worth trying if you'll like the innovative combat system and refreshing Chinese inspired handdrawn art style.
