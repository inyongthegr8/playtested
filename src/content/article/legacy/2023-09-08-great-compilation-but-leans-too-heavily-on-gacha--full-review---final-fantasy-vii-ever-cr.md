FINAL FANTASY VII EVER CRISIS

Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is a gacha mobile RPG that attempts to bridge the gap between nostalgia and mobile gaming. Developed by Applibot and published by Square Enix, it delves into the rich world of Final Fantasy VII, encapsulating the original game, its spin-offs, and even an original storyline.

While this is a global release, Ever Crisis doesn't seem to support all regions, particularly in SEA countries, requiring the use of a VPN. Players in those countries can try using a VPN for the UK or US region to see if the game will connect.

Ever Crisis beautifully blends elements from the original 1997 release and the more recent remake. During non-combat story segments, the game pays homage to the classic with charming chibi-style character designs. These characters are still detailed and charming, capturing the essence of the original game while offering a fresh perspective. This approach is largely the same and consistent for other newer titles as well such as Crisis Core.

The real visual spectacle, however, emerges during the actual turn-based combat. Ever Crisis boasts highly detailed CGI-like graphics that can rival current-gen consoles. When I first saw it, I actually thought it was a cutscene, but then it was in fact actual gameplay. The transition from story to combat graphics can be a bit jarring at times, but you get used to it after a while.

Ever Crisis ambitiously draws from all existing Final Fantasy VII lore, encompassing the original game, Crisis Core, and an original story. More FF7 games like Dirge of Cerberus are also planned to be added along the way. It's a comprehensive effort to create a cohesive narrative that fans can appreciate. While not every plot element made it into the game, it does an admirable job of capturing the major events.

In addition to revisiting familiar storylines, Ever Crisis introduces an original story based on the now-defunct The First Soldier battle royale, offering players an early perspective on the Final Fantasy VII saga. This storyline focuses on a team of SOLDIER candidates and explores the origins of the legendary hero Sephiroth. This storyline is actually a big deal and it‚Äôs surprising that it‚Äôs being told in a gacha game format.

The variety of game modes, including the three main stories (FF7, Crisis Core, and First Soldier), provides players with a wealth of content to explore. However, the monthly installment release schedule for the story content can be frustrating for those eager to consume it all at once.

Ever Crisis retains the turn-based combat system from the original Final Fantasy VII, a decision that will please fans of the classic gameplay. The Active Time Battle (ATB) system returns, allowing players to interrupt an opponent's turn to execute skills and magic. It also eliminates the waiting periods associated with turn-based combat while maintaining a steady pace. It pays homage to the original while adding a layer of strategy to battles. Of course, as a gacha game, you can automate and fast forward the combat.

The game stories are divided into chapters, each comprising a mix of story segments, combat sequences, exploration gameplay, or a combination of these elements. Whether you're revisiting iconic moments from the original game, exploring new storylines, or trying to upgrade your characters by gathering enough materials and doing daily quests, cooperative missions, and challenges, Ever Crisis offers variety that keeps players invested.

Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Ever Crisis is its monetization model. The game is free to play, but it heavily relies on gacha mechanics, loot boxes, and battle passes to acquire new weapons, characters, and upgrades. Premium currency is the key to rolling for these in-game items, and it's essential for progression, especially if you want to keep up with recommended power levels in a short amount of time and grind. Self-promoted pop-ups intrude the players at every opportunity and players may feel pressured to spend real money on premium currency. Stamina, necessary for solo content missions, depletes and requires waiting for it to refill or paying cash.

Almost every aspect of the game seems monetized, making it feel like free-to-play gaming at its most aggressive. Shame, because the actual combat and story is actually done really well and encapsulates the entire FF7 saga in a neat and fun way. Money won‚Äôt solve everything though, as Ever Crisis releases its story content in monthly installments, which would still require players to wait for more content.

While the gacha system is a common feature in many mobile games, it's blatantly aggressive in Ever Crisis. This can be a huge downside especially for console and PC Final Fantasy fans who may have been hoping for a more traditional premium Final Fantasy experience.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is a mobile RPG that walks the shaky line between nostalgia and modern monetization methods. It's a great middle ground between the original and remake style of storytelling and graphics. In fact, some might even prefer this approach to remaking FFVII in terms of gameplay and visual style, but it leans too heavily on the mobile gaming gacha aspects, making it a challenging game to get into for console and PC Final Fantasy fans.
