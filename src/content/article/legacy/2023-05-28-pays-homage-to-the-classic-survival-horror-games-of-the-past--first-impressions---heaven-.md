Heaven Dust, developed and published by One Gruel Studio, is a zombie survival game that aims to capture the essence of classic survival horror titles like the original Resident Evil titles while delivering a modernized 3D experience.

You wake up in a mansion, a former research center that has now transformed into a labyrinth teeming with menacing zombies and treacherous traps. In order to survive, you must face these dangers, gather items, solve puzzles, all while revealing a mysterious storyline that unfolds gradually as they explore the mansion and uncover hidden documents and diaries. The narrative is intriguing, as players piece together the events that led to the mansion's current state and their own presence within it. While the story is not overly complex, it provides enough motivation to drive players forward

At the start, you can easily tell that this game is inspired by the classic Resident Evil games. The typewriter sound bits used to open the survival story, as well as the gameplay mechanics upon the start of the gameplay confirmed my suspicions. Even the menus, item combination system, safe room storage box, heart rate graph indicating health, and healing herbs are all ripped straight from classic Resident Evil.

Heaven Dust offers a mix of puzzle-solving, exploration, and zombie survival, creating a well-rounded gameplay experience that we are all familiar with. As you navigate through the mansion in an isometric view, you'll encounter various puzzles and riddles that require observation, critical thinking, and item combination/manipulation to progress. The puzzles are well-designed and logical, offering a good balance of head scratching and satisfaction.

The combat in Heaven Dust is reminiscent of the shooting system in Resident Evil, you just equip the weapon, raise it up, and click at the zombies you'll frequently encounter throughout the mansion. While combat mechanics are relatively straightforward, they require strategic positioning and resource management to overcome the undead.

Heaven Dust introduces players to a mysterious storyline that unfolds gradually as they explore the mansion and uncover hidden documents and diaries. The narrative is intriguing, as players piece together the events that led to the mansion's current state and their own presence within it. While the story is not overly complex, it provides enough motivation to drive players forward, and the multiple endings based on player choices offer replayability and encourage further exploration.
