## Pros



- The action-packed catchy soundtrack


- World Tour singleplayer “RPG” game mode


- A new stellar mechanic called the Drive System


- Very newcomer friendly with new control mechanics


- Commentary option capturing the feel of a highly competing esports environment## Cons


-Story is lackluster

-World Tour progression is grindy

Street Fighter 6 offers an impressive array of game modes that cater to both single-player enthusiasts and online warriors. The main single player component is the ambitious World Tour, which transforms the game into a sprawling RPG experience. As a created character, you embark on a journey, becoming a disciple of the main characters, learning their moves, and building your skills. Despite some shortcomings in the story and the protagonist's presence, the immersive gameplay, customization options, and gradual introduction to Street Fighter fundamentals make the World Tour a captivating experience.

Just like other games before it, Street Fighter 6 adds new chanics that make it a compelling fighting game, more specifically, it adds something called the Drive System.   Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush, Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. plus a Burnout mechanic if the drive gauge runs out where drive abilities are more dangerous to you.
