The Division Resurgence, one of Ubisoft's installments in the popular action RPG series (alongside the upcoming The Division Heartland), brings the post-apocalyptic world of The Division to mobile devices. This fully-fledged third-person shooter attempts to capture the essence of its console predecessors while catering to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by mobile gaming. As a player with an extensive history in the franchise, diving into the mobile adaptation raised questions about how well the gritty realism and addictive gameplay loop of The Division could be translated to the smaller screen.

True to its roots, Resurgence is a third-person cover shooter, emphasizing tactical combat in a post-pandemic urban landscape. The transition to mobile introduces touchscreen controls that surprisingly work well. The game's controls include the usual array for a mobile shooter but expand to accommodate the complexity of The Division's RPG elements, including two weapons, three abilities, cover, jump, and roll buttons.

Combat in Resurgence successfully captures the smooth and satisfying feel of its console predecessors. Whether it's dropping enemies with headshots or strategically taking down foes, the shooting mechanics remain precise and responsive. The decision to include a variety of abilities adds depth to combat, though the touchscreen controls may present a learning curve. The support for physical controllers and even full keyboard and mouse, however, transforms the experience, making it feel akin to playing on a console or even PC.

Resurgence retains the familiar progression system of the main games. Collecting gear sets for bonuses and upgrading equipment continue to be the driving force behind character development. The game, at least the CBT, features four Specialities, offering players different playstyles. The inclusion of a full campaign and open-world gameplay enhances the mobile experience, keeping the loop of missions, loot, and upgrades intact.

It really is a fully fledged The Division experience on mobile, with console-like graphics and presentation. The best part is, it's available for a variety of mobile phones, not restricted to just the latest iPhones. The game is still not out yet, with plans to release next year. However, there is a Closed Beta that has started recently and will last until December.
