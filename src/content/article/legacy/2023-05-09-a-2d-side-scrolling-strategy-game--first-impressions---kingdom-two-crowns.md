In Kingdom Two Crowns, players must build and defend their kingdoms from enemy attacks while also exploring the world and recruiting new citizens to join their cause. Players can customize their characters, upgrade their defenses, and even tame wild animals to help them in battle. Kingdom Two Crowns+ is the Apple Arcade version that was recently released for the subscription service.

The game's premise is simple: players take on the role of a monarch tasked with building and defending a kingdom from enemy attacks. Players can only move left or right on a 2D pixel world. There is a main underlying resource which is the gold coins, which is used to basically do almost all actions in the world. Players must explore the world, gather resources, and recruit new citizens to help them in their quest. Along the way, they must also build and upgrade their defenses to fend off increasingly powerful waves of enemies, and slowly expand their territory.

While the player is building his Kingdom, he can also roam around the 2D side scrolling island and encounter many gameplay features like ruins, wild beasts, gold or gem chests, and enemy portals to cleanse and capture. The player can also build a ship and travel to another faraway island with the promise of obtaining higher tier technologies and continue building a kingdom there.

One of the key gameplay mechanics in Kingdom Two Crowns+ is the management of resources. Players must carefully balance their spending and investment of gold coins to ensure they have enough resources to build and upgrade their defenses while also having enough coins to perform other actions such as upgrading the town hall and other structures, or recruiting more people.

Kingdom Two Crowns+ also offers the ability to assign citizens to different types of roles to help in the development of the kingdom. Each role has its own unique abilities and strengths, and players must strategically choose which ones to recruit and when to use them. For example, players can choose to create builder units to help build the kingdom more effectively, or they may choose archers or pikemen to serve as hunters and soldiers, each of whom has different strengths and weaknesses such as range and damage.

The game also includes a split-screen co-op mode, which allows players to team up with a friend to take on the challenges together, with both players controlling each side of the touchscreen, or an optional physical controller connected over bluetooth. This adds an entirely new dimension to the gameplay, as players must work together to coordinate their defenses and manage resources effectively. The co-op mode is seamless and easy to jump into anytime in the gameâ€™s settings, and easy to turn off once the session is complete, making it a great option for players who prefer to play with friends.

While it did release on PC and consoles first, Kingdom Two Crowns+' simple controls, mechanics, and pixel art are a perfect match for providing a fun mobile game experience.
