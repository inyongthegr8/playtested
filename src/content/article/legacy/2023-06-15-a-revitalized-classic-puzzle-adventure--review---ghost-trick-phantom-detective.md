Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective has been revitalized with completely HD graphics and flawless animations, breathing new life into its charming world. The game is set to be released on June 30, 2023, but there is a demo on Steam already available for players to try. I was able to play the demo version that allows players to experience the story up to Chapter 2. Notably, any saved data from the demo can be seamlessly transferred to the full version of the game once players purchase it.

The transition to HD graphics in Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is nothing short of breathtaking. Every scene, character, and object is rendered with high level to detail coming from the almost pixelated graphics of the Nintendo DS version, boasting stunning visual fidelity that showcases the game's unique Art Deco cartoonish art style in all its glory. The beautifully designed characters are now fluidly animated instead of being in retro-ish low frame rate, while the environments exude a level of detail that was previously unappreciated.  That being said, the game is still not in full 16:9 screen aspect ratio, rather, it has thick borders on the sides that are used as a UI element for the gameplay.

The enhanced animations in the remastered version further elevate the gameplay experience. Every movement and action is rendered in a very surreal fashion, enhancing the immersion and making the world feel more alive than ever before.

The remastered version also introduces new optional music arrangements ranging from melancholic piano pieces to thrilling orchestral scores, by the renowned composer Yasumasa Kitagawa, the celebrated composer known for his work on the Great Ace Attorney series. Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective not only enhances the gameplay and audio experience but also introduces a gallery of artwork and music.

At its core, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective maintains the same unforgettable gameplay and compelling narrative that made the original game a unique and memorable title. As Sissel, a recently deceased man with a ridiculously tall yellow cone shape of a hair — now a ghost — with the ability to possess objects and manipulate the physical world. With these powers called “ghost tricks”, players must unravel the mysteries surrounding their own death and save other characters from their impending demise. The intricate environmental and situation puzzles, which require creative thinking and manipulation of the environment to affect its surroundings and change the fate of anyone nearby, remain as engaging and challenging as ever with its time sensitive manner.

The gameplay revolves around Sissel's attempt to possess objects individually, desperately reaching from one object to another due to the limited range of his powers. Aside from pausing time to possess an object, Sissel also has the ability to travel back in time to the final four minutes before someone’s death, in an effort to save their life. This time-travel ability allows him to continuously attempt different approaches while seeking additional clues to advance in the game. These puzzles are designed with a time limit, creating a sense of urgency and challenge for players. However, the forgiving nature of the game allows players to retry and make multiple attempts until they find the solution.

The game's narrative is filled with an intriguing detective-esque story and a sharp, witty, and funny dialogue that has aged relatively well even more than a decade later. These dialogues aren’t fully voiced, which would have been a great icing on the cake for this remaster, so prepare for a bit of heavy reading -– especially that the game is heavily story driven. The game frequently has prolonged dialogue sequences, which can sometimes hamper the player's excitement to engage in some puzzle solving, ghost trick action. Other than that, the game is at its best when you’re trying to solve puzzles.

Conclusion:

Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a visually stunning return of the brillant Nintendo DS puzzle-adventure. The transition to completely HD graphics, flawlessly smooth animations and the addition of new music revitalizes the game's visual presentation, both for modern and returnee audiences alike, while retaining its unforgettable time manipulating puzzle-adventure gameplay and enthralling narrative.
