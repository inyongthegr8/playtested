Cat of Khronos is a game that allows you to travel freely in the fourth dimension —  time itself. You must use your god given ability to overcome obstacles in the form of lamp post-looking guards, retrieve the fish for some reason, and make it back in time to be transported into the next level.

If there was ever a game that could accurately convey the sensation of traversing the fourth dimension as a fourth dimensional being, Cat of Khronos would undoubtedly be one of the games that can be used as an example.

Cat of Khronos gameplay setup involves the timeline representing the flow of time, which is conveniently numbered from 1 onwards — representing each point in time. Ordinary mortals can freely travel between the 3 dimensions, but are stuck traveling the flow of time from 1 onwards only (chronologically)

Not the Cat of Khronos, it can freely choose to travel between different points in time. For example, it can start from number 5, then 6, then go back to 3.

In each level, the only objective is to retrieve the fish and return to the starting point at the correct time. It’s an easy sounding task that can be easily completed without time-travel shenanigans, but the presence of vigilant guards who pursue the player upon detection and the strict time constraints for a successful return makes things complicated.

These guards are strategically positioned to impede players from completing levels without cleverly navigating around them using time travel. Success hinges upon meticulous planning, requiring players to think ahead and strategize their moves. Perhaps you'll need to lure a guard away, vanish into the time stream, reappear behind them later, or perhaps you'll need to alert guards at a later time, travel back in time to move freely, and then reemerge at that later moment to evade capture.

Personally, I found myself grappling with the mechanics of Cat of Khronos as early as the second level. The basic mechanics eventually clicked, and I was able to progress through subsequent levels. Just when I thought I was getting the hang of it, the game would suddenly introduce even more challenging puzzles. Which usually involves a larger level, with more guards and complicated positioning to complete.
