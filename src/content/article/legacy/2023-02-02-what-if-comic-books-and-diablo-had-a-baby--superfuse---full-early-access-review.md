There are a lot of ARPGs out there already, but what makes Superfuse unique is its cell-shaded comic-book art-style. It’s not just cell shaded graphics, because even the effects and texts are comic-book inspired. This is something that even Marvel and DC games have failed to utilize and capitalize on, considering they are comic-book franchises. Superfuse combines cell-shaded comic-book art style, looter elements, with some action packed hack ’n slash mechanics.




## Pros



## +Unique cell-shaded comic-book art-style


## +Feature complete mechanically


## +Combat is mechanically fun


## +Endgame already in place




## Cons


-Steep price for an Early Access

-Shallow content for now

-Needs more fine tuning

It has a sci-fi setting, but it still feels like a fantasy ARPG.

Superfuse is set in a science-fiction setting, a departure from the medieval fantasy setting that most ARPGs use. However, don’t let the sci-fi and comic book element fool you as it is still every bit as gory, bloody, and magical as those fantastical settings. The gory nature is immediately evident even in just the first mob you kill, essentially turning it into a highly exaggerated blood splatter - a visual trend that is consistent across the game. You also have typical magic skills like Meteor, or elemental damage types like Fire and Lightning, despite the sci-fi setting.

The aforementioned gore and blood splatters, while it adds a nice artistic flavor, doesn’t synergize very well with the gameplay. When combined with all the other skill effects and comic-book font damage numbers, It mostly leads to visual clutter that is blocking a lot of what’s happening.

A triumvirate of characters

We start off by choosing and creating our character by selecting from one of the three available classes called Enforcers: The Berserker, a warrior archetype focused on melee; The Elementalist, who is basically the mage type focused on ranged and casted skills; and The Technomancer, which is the necromancer / summoner class specializing in controlling minions.

Gameplay Analysis and Features

The Berserker is the most kinetic fun character out of the three because of its up close melee combat. The Elementalist is the most visually appealing because of the flashy colorful spells, while the Technomancer is the most versatile with its wide range of summons and damage dealers.

You can either play offline or online, a highly appreciated feature. Although there is no way to transfer a character from offline to online and vice versa once you have made your decision. There are a lot of negative reviews on Steam right now because there are on-going server problems, so the online aspect is currently affected as of writing.

There is no controller support (but it is planned) and no option for WASD movement, so it plays more like a classic point and click ARPG like Diablo II. The story is light and I didn’t see any heavy narrative driving the game, but it's mainly about an outbreak of zombies called “Corrupted” roaming around the town of Eros that you, Enforcers, have to clear, with up to four players total cooperatively. Across the Early Access campaign, you will take on different missions that will revolve around this goal. All while leveling up from 1 to 30 and making your character more powerful.

Superfuse your DNA

The main attraction of the gameplay, as with the name "Superfuse", is the ability to “Fuse” skills with DNA upgrades conveniently called Fuses that can modify it in different ways; like stat boosts, adding additional projectiles, making them homing, extending the range of the skill, and many more. And you are not limited to one or two only, you can combine multiple fuses together, as long as you got the skill points. These are basically what you call gems or runes in other RPG games, but much more expanded and free. As if you are the developer trying to create skills and its effects from scratch.

This system basically allows you to “Tailor your skills to fit your unique preferences”, which gives the game a multitude of gameplay style opportunities when factoring in the amount of Skill-Fuse permutations that the game offers, even if it only has three character classes. The overall combat loop is entertaining enough for an ARPG, and lands somewhere between Diablo II and III, but with more freedom and customization. Although the pacing of the progression especially in the earlier parts of the game could still be improved.

A good foundation in place

There is a campaign / story mode already playable partially, with an endgame system also available for players to try early after the incomplete campaign ends.  The endgame is already in a playable style which gives us a nice sneak peek of its potential replayability once it's released; After the story ends, you gain access to the Solar Map to take on endless contracts for new loot and upgrades.

There is clearly a good foundation already in place with this Early Access release. Superfuse is basically feature-complete mechanically, with a fully functioning combat system that is satisfying to play and visually appealing to see. The characters available are partially equipped skill-wise, and with what's available, are all fun to experiment with.

Conclusion:

Devs are pretty confident with Superfuse to set the price high for an Early Access title, and confidence is a good thing, but as of now, it's too high of a price ($25) for just a potential. While the game is feature-complete mechanically, the campaign and the skill trees are still not complete. The skills and the pacing of the progression and loot will need a lot of fine tuning to be able to provide a polished experience for players. Some might also say the three character roster is too few and lacking, despite the heavy skill customization.

With many of the future features still open-ended and subject to player feedback, there will be less feedback if there aren’t any early adopters due to the high price. Ultimately, It’s a game teeming with potential, but its high price point can be tough pill to swallow for many.
