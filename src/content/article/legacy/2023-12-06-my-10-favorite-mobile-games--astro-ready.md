It's been an exhilarating journey for mobile gamers in 2023. From simple casual and retro games to complex high budget ARPGs and even Triple A titles, the mobile gaming landscape has been nothing short of dynamic. The platform has been exponentially growing and starting to take over even the PC and Console space, and it's only going to get better.

This year has seen a robust collection of new anime adaptations, fresh titles, and impressive ports making their mark on the small screen, mirroring the diversity and quality present in their big brother counterparts, PC and Console.

As the year draws to a close, I'm delighted to present a collection of my favorite titles that I've played on mobile on both iOS and Android, strictly not in order. This is only based on my taste and preferences, as a primarily an all-around gamer that plays games in all kinds of platforms, mobile games included.

Note that this list is primarily based on the games I've had the pleasure of playing and reviewing here on TapTap, and as much as possible, I only chose those who have been official released, not in beta testing or early access. Nonetheless, it is a diverse and comprehensive perspective on the year's mobile gaming landscape.


### GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE
Goddess of Victory: Nikke, or Nikke is a free-to-play sci-fi shooter that has garnered attention for its action-packed gameplay and, well, it's rather unique exaggerated physics. 

The game features a cast of buxom waifu characters, each armed to the teeth and ready for action. While the gameplay itself is no joke, what really sets Nikke apart is its over the shoulder and cover action, and playful approach to character movement, where the recoil from shooting causes certain assets to, shall we say, exhibit quite noticeable jiggle. It's unapologetically over-the-top, and players have embraced it for its fan service fun.


### Snowbreak: Containment Zone
Snowbreak: Containment Zone is a popular 3D sci-fi third-person shooter game where players navigate the mysterious  ‘containment zone’ with a squad of waifu heroes equipped with diverse skills, gun types, and abilities. 

It delivers a satisfying gaming experience for fans of the PvE shooter genre and those who enjoy collecting and customizing waifu characters.  The fun combat, intriguing storyline, and stunning visuals make it a game worth trying out.


### Resident Evil Village
Resident Evil Village for iOS is not a perfect port, and there are still plenty of room for improvement, but this game in this list signifies something big is coming for mobile game. Something triple A in nature and I'm excited for what's to come.

It's arrival on mobile devices marks an exciting AAA expansion into mobile gaming courtesy of Apple and Capcom. On mobile devices, it still provides a solid AAA gaming experience, especially for those who appreciate the horror genre and are okay with the compromises to the visuals/performance for portability.


### Aether Gazer
While it may have some minor flaws, Aether Gazer's visual quality, production values, and intense combat may make it a worthwhile adventure for fans of action-oriented gacha RPGs. If you prefer directly controlling your characters in an action-packed hack and slash gameplay instead of the usual auto-combat and idle gameplay, this game is worth a try.


### Coromon Global
Coromon captures the essence of classic monster-taming RPGs while injecting its own unique personality into the mix. Its appealing pixel art evokes nostalgia while offering a fresh perspective. T

he gameplay of Coromon is not groundbreaking nor innovative,  but you don’t always need those qualities when the game understands its purpose and remains enjoyable at the end of the day. 

With its tactical turn-based battles, diverse creature collection, and an engaging evolution system, all available with a free trial and a $5 upfront cost to unlock everything else, without hidden microtransactions, trying out Coromon is a choice you can't go wrong with.


### Battle Chasers: Nightwar
The game's engaging storyline, strategic gameplay elements, and visually stunning art style create an immersive experience that effectively translates the essence of the comic series into video game format. Despite minor issues with map design and touch controls, Battle Chasers: Nightwar delivers a unique and unforgettable journey, making it a must-play for RPG enthusiasts on the mobile platform.


### Honkai: Star RailGlobal
One of the only games that I was not able to Review here on TapTap but is nonetheless a stellar game, Honkai: Star Rail seamlessly blends captivating storytelling with engaging gameplay. The game's stunning visuals, strategic battles, and a diverse cast of characters contribute to an immersive experience that keeps players hooked. 

Its successful integration of the Honkai Impact universe ensures a familiar yet refreshing adventure for fans.  With its well-executed mechanics, compelling narrative, and high production values, Honkai: Star Rail stands out as another great example of a free-to-play game with a high production value and stellar support, done right.


### Hitman: Blood Money — Reprisal
Hitman: Blood Money — Reprisal excels in maintaining the narrative depth, visual quality, and core gameplay mechanics that defined the Hitman series. The transition to touch controls is seamless and thoughtfully made, offering an intuitive and responsive experience for mobile gamers.

For those mobile players dreaming of playing the new Hitman games on their phones, this is the next best thing to that and arguably an even better experience, provided that you haven’t played this old gem yet. You just have to swallow the upfront cost in exchange for a decent premium title, without any ads or in-game purchases.


### Brotato
Brotato is a highly addictive Vampire Survivors-like game that is perfect to play on mobile phones with its mindless one handed controls and simplistic yet addicting gameplay mechanics. 

For those unfamiliar with the genre, it’s basically a bullet-hell wave roguelite survival game, where you control only the movement of your character, and all the skills and damage dealers just fire automatically. It’s almost an idle game of sorts, but you still have to move the character to avoid the waves of enemies and projectiles that can kill you, or in simpler terms, a moving lone tower defense game.

Everyone should just try it, whether you are a Vampire Survivors veteran or a newcomer to the genre.


###Vampire Survivors
Vampire Survivors is a game so great and iconic it created its own genre - the survival one hander rogue-lite genre. A perfect example of graphics doesn’t matter. Even if you’re one who usually cares for graphics in a game, even if you don’t like what you’re seeing from the screenshots and videos, I’d still recommend giving it a try and experiencing it yourself, especially that it is now completely free-to-play for Mobile, without any ads or pay-to-win schemes.
