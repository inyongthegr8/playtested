Tumbling Zoo-rock it is a fun cute casual game where animals chase each other, bump each other, and eat each other. Wait, doesn‚Äôt this happen in real life too?


**Pros:**


+Chill game

+Cute simple visuals

+Mechanics are deep for an .io consumption game


**Cons:**


-Limits your play to a few times per day only (unless you pay)

-rudimentary zoo management element

üìùNotable points:

Ads with rewards

In-app purchases

Tumbling Zoo-rock it, is a consumption game reminiscent of .io games such as agar.io and hole.io where you need to consume food and other players to make yourselves bigger, with the ultimate goal of becoming the biggest player on the map with the most eaten animals by the timer ends.

agar.io

hole.io

The game basically adopts the same formula and adds some new changes to it that makes players put in more work in order to consume other players. It is currently still under development but the developers have made a demo available for players to try.

You cannot outright eat other animals if the levels are close enough, but you end up bumping them to drop their ‚Äúmeat‚Äù and make them smaller. Other animals with higher levels aren‚Äôt always automatically a death sentence as well, because you can attack them from the sides and bump their ‚Äúmeat‚Äù off as well.

Players can control different kinds of animals (depending on their choice) that are unlockable via various in-game currencies, and some of them will have a different minor difference like stats and attributes, providing variety and some form of added layer to the consumption game format, some are just pure cosmetic

Some animals run faster, some can recover stamina better, and some can get bigger. All animals also have some abilities that they can use to help close the gap with other animals. Usually it is a pounce move. The system isn‚Äôt complicated, you just keep holding the move button and stop holding it to activate the ability, then it cools down for a few seconds before being available again.

Tumbling Zoo-rock it also features a skill progression system in the form of Zoo that houses animal pens for different types of animals. I noticed four different kinds of pens that divide the roster of playable animals. Upgrading each pen will result in upgrading the stats and attributes of that animal type. It‚Äôs a very rudimentary zoo management element for now, but it's a nice added flavor for the core .io gameplay. All the player's animals will be housed in this pen. Additionally, the pen also earns passive coin income from "zoo visitors" the higher the pen levels.

In this game, Ads are very powerful and a win-win situation for the developers and the players. Some choices have an alternative ad option that provides much more powerful bonuses like the ability to revive on a max level, gaining more gold than usual, or unlocking more playable animals.

Aside from ads, players can also purchase some in-game currency to speed up the progression, however I don‚Äôt see any reason to spend money in this game, as it is already fun, enjoyable chill experience, provided that you are fine with the play time limiting energy system, where you can only play up to five times per day.

While Tumbling Zoo-rock it is simple and fun, wins are not always guaranteed even for experience players. The gameplay is dynamic and considerate enough that players will always have a chance to catch up to higher level players, to even the top player, and big players won't always have the advantage when it comes to eating smaller animals.

Conclusion:

Tumbling Zoo-rock it is a fun IO consumption game with added mechanics that make it deeper than other contemporaries. Its in-app purchases are totally optional and the ads are non-obtrusive as well but offer attractive rewards. However don‚Äôt expect any complexity from its zoo management aspects. If you plan on playing for long sessions, expect to be limited by an energy system.
