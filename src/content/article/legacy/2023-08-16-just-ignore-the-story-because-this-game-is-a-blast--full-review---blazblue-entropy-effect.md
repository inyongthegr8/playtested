BlazBlue Entropy Effect

Steam
BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a 2D side-scrolling Roguelite game developed by 91Act. strangely set in the expansive BlazBlue franchise. Released on Steam in Early Access, this game invites players into a world where the beloved BlazBlue characters meet the dynamic mechanics of a Roguelite adventure.




## Pros
- Gorgeous 2D visuals and lighting system
- Addictive roguelite gameplay loop
- Seven distinct character with their own movesets, skills, and playstyles
- Unique roguelite mechanics




## Cons
- Story is nonsensical



## üìùNotable points: These pros and cons are based on Early Access build and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product

In a surprising departure from the series' established norm of being known for its renowned fighting games, BlazBlue Entropy Effect boldly ventures into uncharted territory with its unique take on the roguelite genre, albeit a bit strangely done (more on that later).

BlazBlue Entropy Effect treats players with a visual splendor that marries the franchise's signature anime-inspired aesthetics with a distinctive and gorgeous paint-like art style. Drawing players into its intricately designed world, the game showcases meticulous attention to detail that translates into vibrant colors, striking character designs, and immersive environments, all complemented by impressive lighting that shines beautifully even on the characters sprites themselves. The animations are equally fluid and smooth, contributing to an overall gameplay and combat system that is seamless and dynamic.

At the core of BlazBlue Entropy Effect lies an addictive gameplay loop that seamlessly intertwines side-scrolling action with the exploratory nature of Metroidvania games. The game features four meticulously designed level types‚ÄîNight City, Ruins, Research Base, and Sakura City‚Äîeach presenting distinct challenges, bosses, and enemy types to conquer.

While BlazBlue Entropy Effect may not achieve the pinnacle of combat fluidity found in titles like Hades, Hollow Knight, or Dead Cells, it still is smooth and compensates with its own distinct sense of empowerment and engagement. The character roster features seven BlazBlue characters: Ragna, Hibiki, Mai, Hakumen, Noel, Kokonoe, and Œõ-No.11, with one more slated as coming soon.

Each of the characters have their own movesets and weapons that range from swords, spears, to even guns. And I found all of the movesets awesome and fun to use. The combat mechanics, although not flawlessly fluid, deliver impactful blows that empower players to engage effectively. This impact, coupled with a carefully maintained balance between challenging boss encounters and regular enemy confrontations, ensures that players remain invested and motivated to hone their skills.

Each run begins with the player selecting a character from the unlocked roster. Subsequently, the game randomly assigns a level type to kick off the gameplay. Upon clearing each area in a level, the player is transported to a Virtual Reality room where a set of random options is presented. These options span from resting to remove entropy-induced debuffs, visiting the store for upgrades, taking a chance on a random bonus, to just simply continuing the run.

Periodically, players are also confronted with a randomized selection of bonuses, ranging from skill modifiers to increased damage output. Upon dying and failing, the concluded run along with the character is saved as an "Evotype." which is a cool feature that I‚Äôve never seen before in roguelites. This saved Evotype can be utilized to augment future runs, or even as a participant in Challenge runs.

As with being a roguelite, there are also persistent upgrades that players can purchase that are unlocked for all characters; such as increased Health points, an additional healing potion, an extra starting currency, or just plain increased damage output. There is also the procedurally generated Space Omega level that constantly refreshes and a Mind Challenge mode that pits you against a powerful boss for a chance to unlock new characters.

The procedurally generated levels ensures that no two runs are alike, encouraging players to adapt and strategize on the fly. The thrill of refining combat techniques, unlocking upgrades, and uncovering the hidden layers of the confusing narrative form a gratifying sense of progression that serves as a driving force throughout the adventure.

Smooth gameplay aside, the story comes across as somewhat nonsensical and pretentious due to its mysterious VR simulation premise and your main character being a robot. The inclusion of BlazBlue characters feels somewhat out of place and doesn't seem to harmonize with the actual BlazBlue franchise. It feels like the game was originally developed as another game entirely, and then suddenly the makers decided to include Blazblue characters out of nowhere even if it didn't make sense. The game is available in three languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, but voice acting is only locked to Chinese.

Conclusion:
BlazBlue Entropy Effect‚Äôs gorgeous 2D visuals, the addictive gameplay loop, and the smooth combat mechanics coalesce to offer an experience that is both riveting and rewarding. While the narrative is total nonsense and the appearance of the BlazBlue characters are out of place, I believe that the game still has lots of potential and is worth considering, particularly given its current discounted price point.
