Neon Abyss is a roguelike retro action-platformer game that was initially released for PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox in 2020, with a mobile port coming soon and now already in Early Access called Neon Abyss: Infinite.

Neon Abyss: Infinite, the revamped mobile version of the beloved PC and console retro game, brings the addictive gameplay and stylish retro aesthetics to the mobile platform. This adaptation to touch controls is well-executed, providing players with a seamless experience on their mobile devices. Although the game retains its core mechanics and charm, it introduces some changes, including free-to-play elements and gacha mechanics. While Neon Abyss: Infinite shows great promise, it is important to note that the game is in Early Access, and therefore, still requires optimization and improvement.

Neon Abyss: Infinite takes place in a futuristic and colorful world where players assume the role of a member of the Grim Squad, tasked with descending into the depths of the Abyss to defeat the New Gods.

Neon Abyss: Infinite maintains its retro-inspired pixel art style, transporting players in a vibrant and neon-lit cyberpunk world with Greek mythology undertones. The visuals are colorful, complemented by neon lighting effects that add a lot of personality to the cyberpunk aesthetic. The enemy designs are varied, from the simple flying mobs to the dynamically generated boss fights. The game's soundtrack is an energetic mix of electronic beats and catchy tunes that enhance the fast-paced nature of the gameplay. However, while the game’s levels are procedurally generated, the game suffers for repetitive looking layouts and elements, with minor reskins and little to no variation in gameplay.

Compared to the original version, Neon Abyss: Infinite stays true to its roots, offering the same gameplay experience as its PC and console counterparts. Players venture through procedurally generated levels filled with enemies, power-ups, and challenging bosses.

Neon Abyss: Infinite incorporates roguelike elements, meaning that each run is unique, with randomly generated rooms, enemy placements, and item drops. This adds immense replay value as players can experience different combinations of challenges and rewards with each playthrough. The game also features persistent upgrades and unlockable items that carry over between runs, allowing players to progressively become stronger and more versatile.

Across the levels, players can acquire and swap between different firearms, magical abilities, and passive upgrades, creating dynamic and diverse gameplay experiences. The game also introduces eggs that can hatch into various companions after some time, and if it results in a successful hatch, can provide different bonuses and support during battles

Unlike many PC and console games that have been ported to mobile and lost their multiplayer functionality, Neon Abyss: Infinite still offers both single-player and cooperative multiplayer modes. This allows players to team up with friends and tackle the challenges of the Abyss together.

The touch controls are well-designed, offering customization options and quality of life features like auto jump and auto fire. These additions compensate for the loss of fine control when transitioning from physical controllers to touch controls. However, it is worth mentioning that while supported, using physical controllers in this version lacks some functionality, such as UI navigation, and suffers from noticeable input lag, which hampers the overall experience.

One of the surprising changes in Neon Abyss: Infinite is the shift to a free-to-play model with added cosmetics and gacha mechanics, which aren’t entirely needed to enjoy the game. This move aims to make the game more accessible to mobile gamers and capitalize on the popularity of these monetization methods.

As an Early Access title, Neon Abyss: Infinite has room for improvement. Performance issues, such as massive frame drops and input latency when using physical controllers, hamper the gameplay experience. These technical shortcomings need to be addressed promptly by the time the game is officially released. Additionally, the shift to a free-to-play model with gacha mechanics presents an opportunity to reach a wider audience but must be carefully balanced to avoid pay-to-win scenarios.

Conclusion:

Neon Abyss: Infinite is set to successfully bring the addictive gameplay and retro charm of the original PC and console versions to the mobile platform. The touch controls are well-implemented, with lots of quality of life features added. However, the game's optimization and technical issues, including frame drops and input lag when using physical controllers, need immediate attention.  With its vibrant visuals, energetic soundtrack, and high replay value, Neon Abyss: Infinite shows great potential to become one of the best roguelike games on mobile, especially that the many popular roguelite games like Hades have unfortunately not come to mobile yet.
