Pocket Playfest: An Indie Celebration 2023 Winter Edition

In a recent hands-on exclusive experience this past weekend, I had the privilege of testing a handful of titles on TapTap's experimental cloud gaming service, setting the stage for this 16-day event where indie game developers show-off their creations exclusively on the TapTap mobile platform â€” fully playable PC games without the need for an actual PC, Android/iOS version, or the need to download the games and install them.  Granted, youâ€™d need to have a reliable internet service to be able to stream these games, and preferably are located in US and Canada for consistent play and latency, at least for now.


## ðŸ”—Join the Playfest

TapTap Pocket Playfest 2023 Winter Edition

## ðŸ“… Schedule
Dates: December 23, 12 AM PT - January 7, 11:59 PM PT.
Playfest Winners & Player Rewards Announcement: January 8, 12 AM PT.

One of the games featured in the event is GigaBash, where players can choose from a colorful roster of 10 unique TITAN characters, each with its own moveset and playstyle. The objective is to unleash havoc and evolve into the terrifying S-Class form.  Each character; Kaiju or Mecha, has different skins available so that all players can pick the same one and still look different from each other. It comes with its own original cast of characters, but you can also buy the Godzilla and Ultraman DLC to really get the most out of this game.

The emphasis on destructible environments makes the game a whole lot more enjoyable than a traditional brawler, as you can pretty much smash buildings, throw, and kick enemies through them and completely level the city. The constant evolution of maps, from flooding lavas to exploding buildings, enhances the dynamic nature of the game.

The combat in GigaBash is fun, energetic, and, chaotic. Each Kaiju or Mecha feels distinct and plays fantastically, with their own movesets and playstyles. The controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used to; the animations sometimes feel stiff; plus the movesets can get a bit repetitive for each character, regardless, I found the overall experience engaging nonetheless, and fun especially if you are playing with friends. It probably the best Kaiju fighting game out there and I highly recommend even just trying the Demo, it even allows you to play couch multiplayer.
