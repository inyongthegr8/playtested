‚ú®Overview
MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE is a free-to-play Battle Royale game set in the world of the hit anime series. Players will have the chance to choose their favorite character, team up with others, and engage in thrilling battles where both heroes and villains alike collide in chaotic battle royale action. The game is available on PC, Xbox, PS, and Switch, but unfortunately, there is no crossplay.


**Pros:**
- Visually captivating
- Captures the feel of the anime in its presentation
- Matches are quick and mini-sized (only 24 players and a small map)
- Responsive Controls
- Free-to-play experience/progression is forgiving but not easy


**Cons:**
- Overly chaotic gameplay
- Imbalanced combat
- Default bindings aren‚Äôt good, at least on keyboard and mouse
- No crossplay, playerbase is instantly divided into the different platforms


üé®Graphics and Art Style
MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE excels in its visual and audio presentation. The game captures the essence of the anime, featuring vibrant and action-packed battles. The character abilities are executed with style, and the dubbing adds an authentic anime feel. It also features some limited form of environmental destruction elements that further enhance the overall immersion and excitement. You can punch through walls, fences, and floors, just like how Anime characters would.

üéÆGameplay
At its core, MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE is a Battle Royale game but the implementation is a bit light. Instead of the traditional 100-player setup on a massive map, this game opts for a mini-sized Battle Royale, accommodating 24 players organized into 8 teams of 3 players each. Players select their starting location before the match begins, and then the playing field gradually shrinks over time. Across the map, they can loot around to get consumable items that heal HP or Armor, or get ability upgrades and passives that will help them gain the upper hand during combat.

The Battle Royale aspect isn't as pronounced as in other games of the genre. The map is relatively small, and encounters with opponents may be sparse in the early stages of a match. Additionally, the shrinking circle is forgiving for like 90% of matches, resulting in less pressure on players to stay within the safe zone.

MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE incorporates Quirks, the unique superpowers possessed by characters in the anime series. Players choose their favorite characters from a diverse roster, each falling into one of five archetypes: Strike, Assault, Rapid, Technical, and Support. These characters not only look and sound authentic but also bring their unique Quirks into battle.

The game encourages teamwork and communication as players form teams of three to take on other squads. Synergizing Quirks with your teammates becomes essential to secure victory in this 24-player Battle Royale. This teamwork aspect coincidentally aligns well with the anime's themes. Of course, this game is best played with friends instead of randoms.

üïπControls
The gameplay experience benefits from fluid animations and highly responsive controls. However, there is a learning curve, particularly when playing with a keyboard and mouse. The game's numerous controls for jumping, dodging, using abilities, melee attacks, and items can be overwhelming at first with all the weird bindings in place. The default keybind choices might not suit everyone, especially for a game with such chaotic battles.

‚öîÔ∏èCombat
The combat is visually pleasing, and is multilayered into different types of attacks, depending on the character used. Three types of abilities are available to the player, along with a basic melee attack. As with other BR games, the player can be downed and subsequently KO‚Äôd if not revived in time. KO‚Äôd players can still be brought back to the game though, if your teammates get their hands on a revive card.

While the combat visuals are mighty impressive, the gameplay can sometimes feel imbalanced. Stun-locking and abilities that send characters flying without a chance to react can lead to frustrating moments. The Battle Royale format amplifies this chaos tenfold, turning matches into free-for-alls with a flurry of abilities and area-of-effect attacks.

üíµMonetization
MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE adopts a free-to-play model with live service elements. Players can log in daily for bonuses and enjoy the game without feeling pressured to spend money. While not overly intrusive, the presence of in-game self-promotion ads can be a minor annoyance for some players.

Unlocking characters and customization options can be achieved through experience gain and completing missions. Notably, the game provides three free tickets to access any character every few hours, making it possible to access the majority of characters through gameplay. Only a few characters are locked behind the gacha system, while the rest are obtained through in-game currency or progression. Cosmetics and additional character customization options round out the rest of the available content.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE combines the popular Battle Royale format with the beloved anime series. It offers a unique and action-packed gaming experience that is sure to resonate with fans of the franchise. The game's visual and audio presentation captures the essence of the anime, immersing players in My Hero Academia‚Äôs world. However, the combat, while visually pleasing, might need some tweaking to be more enjoyable overall. The progression seems fine as it is, offering a balanced free-to-play/premium experience. Let‚Äôs hope it won‚Äôt change in the future and become more grindy, and crossplay support is added in the future.
