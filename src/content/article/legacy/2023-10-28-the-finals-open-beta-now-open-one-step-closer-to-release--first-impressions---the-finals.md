THE FINALS is currently in an open beta test on Steam that started last October 26 and will run up to November 5, available for PC (Steam), Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.

It's basically an FPS game with class-based abilities where teams of three players battle it out with other teams on the map and go for objectives such as collecting cash or defending vaults to win the game.

The open beta currently has limited servers, so it took me a lot of time to find matches, but when I did, its legit tons of fun. The combat in THE FINALS is an explosive, high-octane experience. It's fast paced, but the players have noticeably high HP and take longer to kill than other shooters, youâ€™ll probably unload a magazine or two to kill just one player.

However, the gameplay is still engaging and encourages teamwork, ability use, and proper map knowledge and positioning in order to succeed. The game is firmly rooted in the shooter genre, but it offers a fresh take by merging elements of realism and arcade-style action.

I got disconnected during the tutorial phase, so I had to learn the game mechanics via trial by fire. At first, I encountered some difficulties killing players due to the high TTK (time to kill), but once I found my groove in this game, I started to enjoy it more.

Regarding the abilities, the flashy visuals are not over-the-top and don't create visual clutter, Although the destruction on the other hand is simply superb. I have never seen a game like this since Battlefield introduced total destruction in their games and then subsequently toned down that feature in recent years. In this game, looks like its going all out with the destruction. Walls, Floors, Pillars have been destroyed. Entire roofs have collapse all over our objectives.

There is also a lot of verticality in this game. Buildings have multiple floors and rooftops. There are ziplines to use in the environment, and jump pads to be deployed by the players.

Overall, I had a lot of fun and will be recommend this to everyone to play once it releases. I'll definitely invite my friends to play with me in this game, as playing solo is hard, especially that there are only three players and high TTK.
