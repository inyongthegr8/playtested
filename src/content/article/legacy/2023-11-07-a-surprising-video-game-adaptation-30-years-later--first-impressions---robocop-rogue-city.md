RoboCop: Rogue City is one of the most surprising game releases this year (and one of the most unexpected announcements from as far back as 2021). Just when you might have thought that RoboCop isn't the pop culture icon it once was, it has returned from dormancy and come back to life.

Developing a video game adaptation of an action movie from 1987 isn't typically a top priority for most developers and publishers these days. However, Teyon and Nacon aren't your typical companies. Fortunately, they understandably want to capitalize on the coolness of '80s action movies, having previously delivered the mildly excellent Terminator: Resistance in 2019. And now, we have RoboCop: Rogue City.

The graphics, powered by Unreal Engine 5, exhibit a somewhat high level of fidelity and realism. However, upon closer examination, the character models and textures give off a distinct PS3-era vibe. It's as if they've been ported into Unreal Engine 5 in an attempt to modernize them. Instead, the game feels more like an HD remaster of a non-existent PS3-era title. Interestingly, The developerâ€™s previous game: Terminator: Resistance, look just about the same in terms of graphical fidelity. Nonetheless, the game remarkably captures the essence of the late 1980s, even with its modern graphics engine.

The gameplay offers unadulterated fun, as you charge into missions with guns blazing, mowing down foes without a care in the world. The destructible environment enhances this feeling, taking the experience to new heights. You genuinely feel like an unstoppable killing machine, or, in this case, like RoboCop.

The game truly shines when you're engaged in missions where you're taking down adversaries. However, in between them, during the rather boring police station scenes and dialogue segments, the game still has a certain charm and comical moments that serve as a short reprieve from the relentless action, although I wouldn't miss them if they weren't in the game.

As you progress through the game and level up, you'll unlock new skill perks and upgrades that result in new abilities. This progression system adds to the overall enjoyment, providing more and more ways to gratifyingly eliminate the bad guys as you go deeper in the game's story.
