EA Sports FC Tactical is a football mobile game with a unique twist to it's gameplay. It's tactical turn-based instead of real-time.

Gameplay-wise, EA Sports FC Tactical introduces tactical turn-based matches. While the player movement across the field is automated and presented in a coaching board style, the game shifts into an action-packed matchup mode when players encounter each other. Here, strategic choices like tackling, intercepting, dribbling, passing, or shooting come into play, and the outcomes depend on player ratings and chosen actions.

EA Sports FC Tactical is very clearly still in its early build stage, as they didnâ€™t even change the name yet in-game and it's still bearing the old branding of EA Sports Tactical Football. However, despite this, the game already demonstrates solid performance, even turned up to high graphics settings in my Snapdragon 888 device. I experienced smooth gameplay with a consistent 60fps, setting a positive tone for the overall experience. The gameplay is already solid and I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs.

EA Sports FC Tactical promises to be an exciting addition to the world of football gaming. However, for players located outside the regions where it's officially available, accessing the game can be challenging due to region restrictions.

If you're encountering the infinite loading bug due to region restrictions while trying to access EA Sports FC Tactical, follow these steps to bypass them:

Step 1: Download EA Sports FC Tactical on TapTap
Step 2: Use a VPN and Connect to Indonesia
Step 3: Relogin to Your Google Account and Refresh the Play Store
After connecting to the Indonesian server, log out of your Google account (if you were previously logged in) in your device's settings.
Then, log back into your Google account. This step helps refresh your account's location settings.

Step 4: Update EA Sports FC Tactical via Google Play Store
If you see an update button for EA Sports FC Tactical in the Play Store, it means your VPN and Google account adjustments have worked.

If there's no update button and it displays a Play button instead, it means the google account did not work in tandem with the VPN. I recommended trying another google account.
