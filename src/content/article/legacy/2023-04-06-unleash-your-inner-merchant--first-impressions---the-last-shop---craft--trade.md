Have you ever wondered how it is like on the other side? On the side of the merchant selling goods to heroes and adventurers? The Last Shop - Craft & Trade will exactly let you experience being one. Build a store, receive raw materials, commission goods like weapons and armor to display at your shop. Heroes and adventurers will flock to your store looking for valuable goods to purchase, and it’s up to the player to sell and earn money.

The gameplay of The Last Shop - Craft & Trade banks heavily on the addictive nature of earning money, and so far it works so well. This is done by continually selling goods to adventurers in an ever increasing cycle of crafting increasingly better items, in turn selling for more and more money.

The tutorial is a bit long-winded, It was a bit of an information overload, but it holds your hand and strictly guides you throughout much of the many systems in place. I started off by putting a bunch of display racks that can store items for sale. Then, I also set up a storage for my raw materials. After that, I just crafted my first few items to sell and they’re up there in the display and a customer came and asked for it immediately. The process is simple but it can get addicting quickly.

Aside from managing a store, you can also hire heroes for yourself and order them to go on quests to the outside world for potential rewards. You can also view the city you’re in and sort of “invest” in the different infrastructures in there to get different boosts, such as an increased raw material production or a faster cooldown rate for your heroes.

Since Last Shop - Craft & Trade is free-to-play, there are a lot of in-game purchases available. From simple premium currency top-ups, to increased drop rate for a whole year. Like the merchant game that it is, the whole game is littered with things to spend real money on.

So far, the experience is borderline addicting. Well, that’s a given since the core gameplay mechanic of  Last Shop - Craft & Trade is about selling things and earning huge amounts of money. However, the constant need for manual check-ins, restocks, and manual selling gets a bit tiresome after a while.
