NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a multiplayer online battle royale game that takes place in a fantastical ancient Chinese-inspired world where players — sometimes in teams up to three — compete against each other to be the last one standing. The game stands out from other battle royale titles with its emphasis on fast-paced martial arts based combat and parkour mechanics. It is available for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, with an official mobile version coming soon as well.


**Pros:**


+Fast-paced and skill-based combat

+Fluid and intuitive parkour and traversal mechanics

+A fresh take and a stand out experience from other battle royale games

+Unique setting and AAA level of visuals


**Cons:**


-Performance issues

-Requests you to disable some PC protection feature in order to play, beware

The game's vibrant and detailed environment draws inspiration from ancient Chinese landscapes, filled with lush forests, majestic mountains, and oriental looking structures. Overall, the visual presentation of NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a proper modern AAA-level of experience, although I did experience some constant stuttering or perceived lack of smoothness in the gameplay. While the game offers fast-paced and intense combat, the constant stutters and jittery in the performance, at least in the PC version, could be improved further.

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT offers a fresh take on the battle royale formula, introducing unique mechanics that set it apart from its competitors. Players take on the role of powerful heroes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. The game offers a diverse roster of heroes to choose from, with a progression system to unlock most of them. The combat system in the game is skill-based with a focus on melee engagements but still offers the choice to use ancient ranged weapons. Players can engage in intense duels using a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, and even firearms like portable cannons or archers.

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT offers a gameplay experience focused on high mobility, making it perfect for fast-paced melee action where you can swiftly engage or disengage from enemies. The parkour system in the game is both intuitive and enjoyable, allowing you to navigate the map with ease, vertically or horizontally.

You can climb towers, structures, cliffs, rocks, and even utilize grappling hooks to move around swiftly. The parkour mechanics feel like an evolved and unhinged version of those seen in games like the classic Tenchu or the more modern Sekiro. The movement system feels intuitive and responsive, giving players a heightened sense of freedom and agency in their actions.

Along with its melee-oriented action, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT incorporates traditional battle royale mechanics, such as the usual randomized circular safe zones to go into, looting items and weapons, as well as a huge map for up to 60 players to wander around. Additionally, it includes familiar quality-of-life features such as a revive system, which gives fallen players another chance instead of just sitting around only able to watch their teammates compete. Being able to revive fallen teammates adds a layer of teamwork and coordination, enhancing the overall multiplayer experience.

The game provides Trio and Duo modes right from the start, allowing you to team up with friends or play with a partner. Solo mode becomes available as you progress through the levels, although it would have been nicer if all modes are available from start.

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT features a wide variety of weapons available, each with its unique animations and characteristics. With emphasis on melee and martial arts, the weapon differences are more pronounced here compared to other battle royale shooters where most weapons are just with varying degrees of firepower, fire rate, clip size, and recoil.

Whether you prefer close-quarters combat with swords or long-range engagements with firearms, there is a weapon that suits your style. The fluid animations add a level of satisfaction to the combat, making each strike and attack feel impactful and visually appealing. In addition to the typical loot of weapons and healing items, players have the opportunity to find and loot upgrades called souljades. These souljades function as modifiers that can enhance your character's abilities and provide upgraded acts or skill mannerisms.

As a pick-up and play game, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT features a fast-paced and intense gameplay experience, with matches typically lasting around 15 to 20 minutes. The game's map design is sprawling and intricate, providing ample opportunities for exploration and tactical maneuvering. From dense forests to ancient temples, each location feels meticulously crafted, offering a mix of verticality and open spaces that encourage dynamic gameplay. The map's size strikes a good balance, ensuring that encounters with other players are frequent but not overwhelming. Additionally, the introduction of AI-controlled creatures in the maps and in one the game modes adds an extra layer of challenge and PvE aspect to the matches.

Conclusion:

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT offers a thrilling and dynamic battle royale experience with its focus on high mobility and fast-paced melee combat that truly stands out from the rest with its unique premise. If you enjoy battle royale games but are tired of the cut and dried battle royale shooter formula that we’ve seen a hundred times, then NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a pretty compelling option to try, with its fresh martial arts-inspired take on the battle royale genre, and especially that is now free to play.
