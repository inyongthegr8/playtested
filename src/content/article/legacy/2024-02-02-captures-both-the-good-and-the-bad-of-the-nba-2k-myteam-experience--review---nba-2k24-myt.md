‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 7/10

üé®Visuals and Art
NBA 2K24 MyTEAM Mobile upholds the high visual standards of the series, delivering a realistic and visually impressive basketball simulation on mobile devices, with player models, animations, and environments designed to be as realistic and as close to their console counterparts as possible.

When I played on a mix of medium and high settings, the visuals looked AAA-level amazing, albeit noticeably 'toned down' compared to the console versions. The graphics can be finely tuned to support older hardware, but don't expect the same visual fidelity and performance when playing on low settings. I found the UI icons to be of low resolution and pixelated, and the overall menu design seemed somewhat amateurish and barebones.

üéÆGameplay
The gameplay mirrors the core NBA 2K24 basketball experience, providing the same gameplay feel to it from the motion captured animations and realistic physics engine to the intuitive controls and game mechanics. Touch controls are seamlessly adapted for mobile play, while still properly supporting physical controllers for gameplay (since touch is still used for menus).

However, MyTEAM is all about blending team management seamlessly with on-court action. Players start with a basic roster and gradually build their dream team by collecting player cards and/or upgrading the rating of  current cards. It's important to note that this is not a traditional NBA 2K experience, as you cannot select real-life team rosters to play with. Hopefully, in the future, a game mode will be introduced that allows players to engage with actual team rosters, similar to the setup in EA FC Mobile or eFootball.

Skillfully executing plays, making strategic decisions, and precisely controlling players contribute to the intensity of each match, in which the game can be played on either singleplayer or multiplayer across various game formats.

üìúGame Modes
NBA 2K24 MyTEAM features both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. In singleplayer, players can engage in dynamic 3v3 matchups, full-scale 5v5 games with four 5-minute quarters, or opt for a condensed "Clutch Time" mode with a single five-minute quarter ‚Äì perfect for quick gaming sessions.

Online modes offer the chance to challenge real players in 3v3 and 5v5 settings, while a cooperative 3v3 mode allows players to team up with friends, with each player controlling an individual player instead of a whole team. The game's unique "Clutch Time" mode is available in both singleplayer and online, offering an intensified 5v5 experience with shorter, more intense matches.

üíµMonetization
NBA 2K24 MyTEAM is free to play, accompanied by in-app purchases for the currencies VCs and MTs, allowing players to buy card packs and other in-game items, either via a gacha roll or directly acquiring them in time limited deals. MTs can still be acquired by playing regularly, but players can expect a decent amount of grind to get these. Those seeking to expedite their progress or enhance their team quickly can opt to spend money, thus making the game pay-to-win, especially if you‚Äôre playing online.

üåçMatchmaking woes
In my experience, finding matches takes a long time, and when successful, the solo matchmaking system appears imbalanced, probably due to the lack of players in my team level. Latency disadvantages aside, My 72 OVR team got matched against none other than a team featuring LeBron James, a 96-rated Jermaine O'Neal, plus another 89 rated player. At the very least, you can still play singleplayer and have fun by myself. Honestly, its a better option for me.

üìäTechnical Performance
While NBA 2K24 MyTEAM excels in delivering a visually stunning experience, there have been reported technical issues online in which I‚Äôve also personally experienced. The game seems to be selective when it comes to compatible devices, as it just crashed on my newer ROG Phone 5 while redirecting it to a 2K ‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù website as if I was banned. I installed it on my older Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Tablet (Snapdragon 855) and it worked without these issues.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
Technical issues and weird device compatibiltiies aside, NBA 2K24 MyTEAM's gameplay successfully mirrors the core NBA 2K24 experience while emphasizing team management and player card collecting elements in MyTEAM mode. The game modes offer a diverse range of options for both singleplayer and multiplayer engagement. However, it's worth noting the potential pay-to-win elements and matchmaking issues, particularly if you intend to play competitively online.
