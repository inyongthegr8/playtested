**Cons:**

-World Tour progression is grindy

Street Fighter 6 has come a long way. It features a 18-character roster of both new and returning fighters rendered in new Full 3D art style that looks much closer now to contemporaries like Tekken, than the classic 2D or artistic visuals of Street Fighter, however, the spirit of Street Fighter is still felt here. Street Fighter 6’s roster of 18 characters is mostly familiar, with 12 returning characters and six being entirely new.

One of the first things that grabs your attention in Street Fighter 6 is its visual presentation. The transition from the classic 2D art style to a Full 3D rendering is a breath of fresh air, bringing the game in line with its contemporary peers. The character models are even more detailed now, showcasing intricate details bolstered by smooth animations and vibrant special effects. As a result, the characters do look bigger compared to previous games, there’s something with the camera and the 3D graphics that made it look that way — which can be a turnoff for some.

The sound design in Street Fighter 6 is nothing short of spectacular. The action-packed catchy soundtrack perfectly complements the frenetic battles, pumping adrenaline through your veins all throughout starting from the introduction, battle, and outcome. The sound effects are impactful and satisfying, capturing the weight and impact of each move. There is also a commentary option to make battles feel more bigger than they are, capturing the feel of a highly competing esports environment, without having to be in one. From the clash of fists to the close calls, the audio immersion enhances the overall experience, keeping you engaged and on the edge of your seat.

Whether it's the returning fan-favorites or the 6 new additions, each fighter feels distinct and vibrant. Street Fighter 6 strikes a balance between modern visuals and the series' timeless aesthetic, successfully capturing the spirit of the franchise.

Street Fighter 6 offers an impressive array of game modes that cater to both single-player enthusiasts and online warriors. The main single player component is the ambitious World Tour, which transforms the game into a sprawling RPG experience. As a created character, you embark on a journey, becoming a disciple of the main characters, learning their moves, and building your skills. Despite some shortcomings in the story and the protagonist's presence, the immersive gameplay, customization options, and gradual introduction to Street Fighter fundamentals make the World Tour a captivating experience.

While the story is kind of lame with its writing reaching parody levels of ridiculousness, and the concept of having a created character feels dull with its muted protagonist nature, the actual gameplay is immersive, especially with the customization and personalization you can have with your character – considering you can mix and match the moves of every character. It also does a decent job of introducing newcomers to the basics of Street Fighter 6 by slowly giving them side quests as he progresses throughout the 20 hour or so story . Although you can't have your cake and eat it too, as the grinding takes a lot of time, to be able to acquire character moves.

Fortunately, the player-created RPG character is not limited to the world tour game mode alone. You have the freedom to play your character, along with all the gear they have acquired, to the online Battle Hub. This hub serves as a bustling online social space where you can participate in both ranked and unranked matchmaking, engaging in thrilling battles with players from around the world. Whether you prefer ranked matches or unranked casual bouts, the Battle Hub ensures that there's always a challenge waiting.

Just like other games before it, Street Fighter 6 adds new mechanics that make it a compelling fighting game, more specifically, it adds something called the Drive System.   Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush, Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. plus a Burnout mechanic if the drive gauge runs out where drive abilities are more dangerous to you.

Overdrives are Special Moves, while Drive Rush allows you to quickly close the gap between you and your opponent, Drive Reversals allow you to counter attack, and Drive Impacts which is a powerful game changer attack that can affect the flow of the opponent, either by stunning them if caught while attacking or backed into a corner, depleting their drive meter if blocked, or completely decimate them if they're on a burnout.

At the start of every round you have a full meter and have access to all of them. No need to build this meter, or save it up for the later rounds, which takes away reservations from the player and just allows them to utilize this mechanic at its fullest. Outside these Drive mechanics, most of the traditional Street Fighter 6 combat feel has been retained for the most part.

Gameplay has three control modes now, a beginner, more streamlined mode where special moves are done in just simple button presses; a classic, more hardcore modes where combinations are needed to perform special moves; and a more casual dynamic mode where attacks are done automatically based on the situation

Street Fighter 6's gameplay mechanics strike a delicate balance between accessibility and depth. The three control modes accommodate players of all skill levels, allowing newcomers to jump in and experience the excitement while offering seasoned veterans the opportunity for complex combos and strategies. The addition of the Drive System injects a new layer of excitement, granting characters access to powerful abilities governed by the Drive Gauge. From Overdrives to Drive Rush and Drive Impacts, these mechanics add depth and strategy to each match, offering a range of offensive and defensive options. However, the Burnout mechanic keeps players on their toes, introducing risks and consequences when the Drive Meter is depleted.

Conclusion:

Street Fighter 6 marks an impressive evolution for the renowned fighting game franchise, delivering a fighting game experience that can appeal heavily to both newcomers and longtime fans. The shift to full 3D visuals breathes new life into the series, while the expansive World Tour mode offers an engrossing single-player and a resulting multiplayer aftermath. The gameplay mechanics and  controls strike a balance between accessibility and depth, and the addition of the Drive System is truly the defining mechanic of this iteration.
