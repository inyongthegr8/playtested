Developed by Fantastico Studio and published by Digerati, Black Paradox is a retro style horizontal shoot'em up that features a beautiful pixel art, pumping electronic soundtrack, and fast-paced gameplay that will keep your fingers sweating. It is available on a multiple of platforms, but today we are focusing on the Mobile version.

One of the first things that stands out in Black Paradox is the amazing soundtrack that captures the essence of the 80s with its 8-bit sounding electro-techno music. In addition, the retro pixel art is amazing and visually appealing as well

In Black Paradox, you play as the titular bounty hunter named Black Paradox, who must eliminate the seven leaders of the criminal organization Hellraisers. You control a Delorean-turned-spaceship equipped with powerful weapons, flying through levels filled with a variety of enemies and obstacles, avoiding bullet-hell full of projectiles and patterns from both sides.

The game is difficult and requires the use of both hands to play. The left hand is used to move the ship and activate a special ability that calls for temporary backup, while the right hand is used to shoot and change weapons. Across levels, you can find and equip up to two weapons at a time, including boomerangs, shotguns, and rocket launchers.

Black Paradox is a rogue-lite as well, giving you both temporary upgrades inside runs and persistent upgrades purchasable using credits. The game so far is very interesting, the quality of the pumping electro soundtrack alone is worth trying it out. It is difficult and challenging, but the gameplay is simple and easy to learn.
