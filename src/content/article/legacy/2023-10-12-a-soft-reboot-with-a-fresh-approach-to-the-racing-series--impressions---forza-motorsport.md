Forza Motorsport (2023), developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios, was released on October 10, 2023. Unlike its predecessors, it ditches the numerical sequencing, opting for a fresh approach to the series. The game was launched recently on PC and Xbox. It doesn't focus on an open-world arcade gameplay like its sibling Forza Horizon; instead, it immerses players in the world of motorsport, where the cars, tracks, and competition are the stars. It emphasizes the thrill of racing and the journey to become a top-tier racer.

Forza Motorsport is at its core an exhilarating driving simulator, offering an engaging wheels experience that I would even say as the best in the franchise's history. The gamepad handling is top-notch, providing consistent and realistic control. Its adjustable and tunable difficulty caters to a broad audience, from novices looking for fun casual to seasoned SIM racers.

The car progression system, especially in the career mode, is engaging, starting with stock cars and allowing players to evolve them into competitive vehicles over time. However, outside of the career mode, the progression system is sluggish and requires significant grind.

The game's graphics are a mixed bag. On one hand, Forza Motorsport shines with its stunning particle effects and detailed tracks, breathing life into the racing environment. Ray Tracing, for those who can access it, adds a touch of realism, particularly in reflections and lighting.

However, the visuals are inconsistent and have their fair share of issues. Players may encounter stuttering, broken LODs, and occasional weirdness in car models. Despite its visual improvements, it doesn't consistently offer the jump in fidelity one might expect.

The issues doesn't stop there, the career mode, while engaging, can feel grindy at times. Performance optimization issues hinder the overall experience, and the game's visual inconsistencies leave room for improvement. Overall though, as a driving game for both casuals and veterans --- It's probably the best out there mechanically.
