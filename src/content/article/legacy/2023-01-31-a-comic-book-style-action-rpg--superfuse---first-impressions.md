Released in Early Access today, Superfuse is a brand new Action RPG that combines cell-shaded comic-book art style, looter elements, with some action packed hack ’n slash mechanics.

We start off by choosing and creating our character by selecting from one of the three available classes called Enforcers: The Berserker, a warrior/melee archetype; The Elementalist, who is basically the mage type; and a Technomancer, which is the necromancer / summoner class. You can either play offline or online, a highly appreciated feature. Although there is no way to transfer a character from offline to online and vice versa once you have made your decision.

Superfuse is set in a science-fiction setting, a departure from the medieval fantasy setting that most ARPGs use. However, don’t let the sci-fi and comic book element fool you as it is still every bit as gory, bloody, and magical as those fantastical settings. The gory nature is immediately evident even in just the first mob you kill, essentially turning it into a highly exaggerated blood splatter - a visual trend that is consistent across the game. You also have typical magic skills like Meteor – especially with the Elementalist – despite the sci-fi setting.

There is no controller support (but it is planned) and no option for WASD movement, so it plays more like a classic point and click ARPG like Diablo II. The story is light and I didn’t see any heavy narrative driving the game, but it's mainly about an outbreak of zombies called “Corrupted” roaming around the town of Eros that you and with friends optionally, as Enforcer, have to clear. Throughout the Early Access campaign, you will take on different missions that will revolve around this goal. All while leveling up and making your character more powerful.

The main attraction of this game, as with the name "Superfuse", is the ability to “Fuse” skills with DNA upgrades conveniently called Fuses that can modify it in different ways; like stat boosts, adding additional projectiles, extending the range of the skill, and many more. These are basically what you call gems or runes in other RPG games.

There is a campaign / story mode already playable partially, with an endgame system also available for players to try early after the partial campaign ends, even if the story is not yet fully complete. There are a lot of negative reviews on Steam right now because there are on-going server problems, so the online aspect is currently affected as of writing.

There is clearly a good foundation already in place with this Early Access release. Superfuse is basically feature complete mechanically, with a fully functioning combat system that is satisfying to play and visually appealing to see. The characters available are partially equipped skill-wise, and with what's available, are all fun to experiment with.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
