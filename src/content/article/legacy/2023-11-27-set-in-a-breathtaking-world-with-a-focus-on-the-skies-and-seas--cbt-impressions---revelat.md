Set in a breathtaking fantasy world with a focus on the skies and seas, Revelation M casts players as new adventurers embarking on a journey of exploration, discovery, and adventure.

To start off, Revelation M boasts an extensive character customization system, allowing players to fine-tune every aspect of their avatar, including gender, appearance, and class. The available classes, such as Swordmage, Occultist, Paladin, Blademaster, and Spiritshaper, provide diverse gameplay experiences.

Revelation M follows the typical free-to-play Action MMORPG format on the mobile platform. A game where you can do a lot of things aside from the main story; from taking on endless dungeons and missions, joining guilds, 20 vs 20 arenas, or perhaps engaging in realistic jobs as a musician, cook, singer, or even fashion designer. Each profession offers unique activities and quests, honestly, this game packs a lot of things, but you also get a lot of automation features like auto target, auto camera, auto pathing for quests, and AFK mode for combat.

The initial presentation is very charming, introducing me to a beautiful world that feels utopic in some sense; however, the action is very few and far between. I played for a couple of hours, and I only encountered a little combat for the first hour or two of play. Most of my early experiences were a series of cutscenes, plus running, interacting with, and following NPCs, and the pacing is really very slow.  Although after that, it only gets better as you start to experience more combat and gameplay elements.

There's a need for something to hook players in the early game, and so far, this element is lacking. I wasnâ€™t invested in the seemingly interesting story underneath all the clunkiness in presentation, especially with the robotic computer-generated voice lines. Overall, this game is promising, as the gameplay systems are great individually, but when put together, more work needs to be done to make the game feel polished and finished.
