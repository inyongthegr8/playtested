Evoland 2 is a classic / modern adventure RPG game with a time-traveling theme, not just with the settings, but with whole video game eras and genres altogether.




## Pros



## +Unique alternating blend of different game styles and mechanics across video game history


## +Cohesive time-traveling narrative


## +Colorful cast of charming characters


## +Controller Support




## Cons


-Difficult to use touch controls

-Graphics and mechanics changes might feel a bit jarring

Developed by Shiro Games and published by Playdigious, Evoland 2 is the standalone sequel to the original Evoland and offers a unique blend of gameplay styles , mechanics, and graphics that evolve as the player progresses. In many ways, Evoland 2 clearly improves upon the first game, especially in the narrative, gameplay department, and length.

A time-traveling narrative

Evoland 2 follows the adventures of a young hero, Kuro (the name can be changed) and his companions as they travel through time and space to save their world from a looming threat.  The game's storyline is an epic and sprawling adventure that spans across different eras and dimensions, taking the player on a journey through time and space.

The game’s prologue starts off in a Game Boy low resolution green-ish setting, then immediately switches to a much more modern 2D pixel art graphics that serves as the original medieval fantasy setting the main characters are from.  Overall, it sets the tone for the epic adventure to come, with its lighthearted orchestral score and cinematic presentation. There is no voice acting, so everything must be read by the player.

A travel through time, including video game history

After a while, it will switch back and forth to different 2D and 3D eras of graphics, as well as the setting evolving to include elements of sci-fi, steampunk, and even post-apocalyptic themes. Throughout the game, players will encounter a colorful cast of charming characters, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations.

Gameplay Analysis

The gameplay in Evoland 2 is a unique blend of different game styles and mechanics, ranging from classic 2D action-adventure gameplay to turn-based battles and even card games. They are mostly paying homage to RPGs, but other genres are included as well.

The game's evolution mechanic allows the graphics and gameplay to evolve as the player progresses, starting off with basic 2D graphics and simple gameplay, but gradually evolving to more advanced graphics and complex mechanics, and also going “downgrading” back the graphics, depending on the story progression.

A love letter to classic RPGs and retro games

From the 8-bit pixelated graphics and retro soundtrack to the turn-based battles or even side-scrolling shooter action, Evoland 2 pays homage to the history of video games in a way that feels both old and brand new. If you ever want to go on a video game history tour, while still playing a decent game, Evoland 2 is the one and only perfect fit.

The game never gets stale or boring due to the constant evolutions and gameplay changes along the way. Despite the constant gameplay changes in what feels like demo-ing a bunch of games one at a time, the game’s time-traveling story feels cohesive overall and compelling to play.

When Evoland 2 is in a classic Adventure RPG format — which I would probably label as the game’s main genre — the game's combat system is adapted from a Zelda-style combat where players only have one attack button, no dodge, block, nor a variety spells, except for one ability where the current companion comes to the player’s aid.

When switched to other eras and genres, the gameplay’s combat switches as well, be it a Final Fantasy-like turn-based system, a side-scrolling platformer, a horizontal shooter, or even a Street Fighter fighting game. Sometimes even adapting more unconventional styles like a card game format or a candy crush battle system.

The game also features a variety of puzzles and platforming challenges that require critical thinking and logic, and sometimes careful timing and precision.

In terms of gameplay, Evoland 2 is a significant improvement over its predecessor. While the original Evoland was more of a proof-of-concept that showcased the evolution mechanic, Evoland 2 offers a more polished and cohesive gameplay experience especially in the narrative department. The game's evolution mechanic is also more pronounced and offers a greater sense of progression, with each evolution feeling like a significant milestone.

Another area where Evoland 2 improves upon the first game is in its length and content. The game offers a substantial amount of gameplay, with a story campaign that can take up to 15 hours to fully beat and keeps players engaged throughout the journey. The game also features multiple endings, depending on the choices the player makes throughout the game.

2D to 3D and back again can be jarring

Some minor gripes I had with the game is that its evolution mechanic can sometimes feel disorienting, especially when jumping from a heavily pixelated art-style into a clean and pristine 3D world. These segments sometimes may feel disjointed and unrelated to each other. Sort of giving you a “culture shock” feel whenever there is an evolution.

Touch and Physical Controls

Also, the touchscreen controls are a bit difficult to use, especially with the ever changing control scheme, camera angles, and very rudimentary combat without much room for error.

As for alternative control options, Evoland 2 fully supports physical controllers, as I’ve tested it with a Razer Kishi controller and the game works flawlessly, even supporting UI navigation and hiding the on-screen touch controls.

Conclusion:

A love letter to classic RPGs and retro games, Evoland 2 is a must-play for fans of classic RPGs and connoisseurs of video game history. Its blend of different gameplay styles and mechanics, combined with its epic time-traveling storyline, make it a unique and engaging experience that offers something for everyone. With its improved gameplay, length, and content, Evoland 2 surpasses its predecessor in every way and sets a high bar for future games in the genre. It is not directly related to the first game, so newcomers can try this one out without playing the first.
