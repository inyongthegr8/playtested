NEW UPDATE
Cat Fantasy has extended its reach by launching a dedicated server for Southeast Asian players which was rolled out last October 27. Players in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines can now enjoy these brand new servers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you lead your own catgirl squad in Cat Fantasy, you'll alternate between the management of cat-cafe life and mysterious investigations involving monsters called anomalies, deranged felines, and evil rabbit dolls—all while uncovering the truth behind the existence of an alarming number of diseases plaguing the city.

Players dive into a world filled with waifu catgirl characters, collecting and summoning them for exciting turn-based combat and compelling gacha action.  At its core, Cat Fantasy employs a turn-based combat system reminiscent of the mechanics found in games like 7 Deadly Sins. Players engage in battles by utilizing a deck of cards representing various attacks and abilities. The unique mechanic here is the ability to merge adjacent cards to form more potent attacks, adding a strategic layer to the combat.

Beyond the main story, which spans an impressive number of chapters and missions, there’s also a plethora of side game modes. These include a Cafe management segment where you're tasked with overseeing menu offerings, staff assignments, catering deliveries, and the progressive enhancement of the Cafe’s level. Additionally, there are other combat-oriented game modes catered for the purpose of farming specific materials to level up characters and gathering ingredients for crafting potential menu items in the Cafe.

Currently, the game is a bit generous across the board. There is an stamina/energy system designed to limit play, but I was overflowing with it for the first few hours that I played. I also received a lot of gold for general use, and currency for numerous gacha rolls in which I received one SSR characters early on, and multiple SR characters. While the closed beta test currently underway has gacha and premium currency implemented, the final model of the game remains to be seen. I hope the developers strike a balance that ensures an enjoyable experience for free-to-play players too.
