Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer survival horror game that has gained immense popularity among gamers since its initial debut in 2016 for PC and consoles. It was later made available for mobile devices in 2020. I tried out the recent revamped mobile version of the game called Dead by Daylight Mobile and had the chance to explore its various features and gameplay.

The survivors form a team of four players, taken from a pool of a wide selection of characters, and play in third person view. Their goal is to repair all the generators in the map and activate the exit gate to escape. In many things that they do, such as healing, or repairing generators, there are QTE-like skill checks that you need to perform with a high risk-reward element. The whole premise is very simplistic, but is littered with many interesting elements that make the game exciting for both sides as it plays.

The lone Killer, on the other hand, plays in first person mode. Players can select a killer from a variety of choices, including crossovers of familiar characters taken from popular media, like Pyramid Head from the Silent Hill series, and Sadako from The Ring films. Each killer will have their own ability and playstyle to consider. For example, one killer might have the ability to teleport through walls, and one can turn invisible. Alone, they need to stop the survivors from escaping, and sacrifice them to The Entity by hooking them to posts scattered around the map, long enough for The Entity to claim them.

The game also has a progression system that rewards players for playing the game and achieving certain milestones. Players earn Bloodpoints for playing matches, which can be used to level up their characters and unlock new perks and abilities.  Both roles have these unlockable perks for each of the characters that will allow players to tailor their characters to suit their preferred playstyle, be it a faster healing rate, improved vision, or increased rewards at the end.

The progression system gives players a sense of accomplishment and motivates them to keep playing and improving their skills and to try out other characters. Players can also spend money for new characters and cosmetics, but it is entirely optional and the game is fully playable for free.

Another aspect of the game that I was highly impressed with was the sound design. The audio in the game is excellent, and it adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are realistic, and the background music is eerie and haunting, which helps to create a sense of tension and suspense as you play the game. The audio cues are also well-designed and help players to stay aware of their surroundings, anticipate the killer's movements, and also intensifies the panic experienced by the players when being chased.

Playing as a survivor, my experience so far has been heart-wrenching and I felt like I was a character in a horror movie trying to survive. Playing as a killer is a power fantasy experience that feels empowering while at the same time a challenging task, taking on four player-controlled survivors all at once. If you love survival horror and multiplayer games, Dead by Daylight Mobile is looking like great combination of the two that you should try.
