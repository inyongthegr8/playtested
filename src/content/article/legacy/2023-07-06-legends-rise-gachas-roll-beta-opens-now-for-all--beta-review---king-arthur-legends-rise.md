+Crossplay and cross progression with PC and mobile

+ARPG style of gear and itemization


**Cons:**

üìùNotable points:

These pros and cons are based on Open Beta Test and does not accurately represent the quality of the finished product

King Arthur: Legends Rise is an upcoming turn-based squad RPG coming to Android, iOS and PC, with options for cross-play and cross-progression. An Open Beta Test is now available only for Android which will last until the official launch date. according to the iOS app store page, the placeholder expected release date is December 5, 2023, however take this info with a grain of salt.

The game features highly detailed graphics rival those of AAA games, showcasing the medieval era with meticulous attention to detail. The gritty art style perfectly captures the atmosphere of the time, immersing players in a world filled with medieval castles, lush landscapes, and infused with fictional mythical creatures. The graphics aren't that polished yet, especially the lighting system, but you can clearly see the amount of detail put into the textures and models in this game.

The core gameplay of King Arthur: Legends Rise lies in its turn-based squad battles. Players must assemble a party of knights, mages, rogues, and other legendary heroes, each with their unique skills and abilities. Some skills are used defensively, some are AOE, some are for single targets. The battles are challenging but rewarding, with epic boss fights and encounters with mythical monsters that will test your strategic prowess.

Presentation wise, the game hits all the right notes when it comes to the combat presentation, with expressive animations and engaging effects that immersively draw players into the heat of battle. Each attack and ability is accompanied by visually stunning effects that heighten the excitement and intensity of the gameplay. The game is presented like an Action RPG with all its cool animations, without actually being one.

Unlike many contemporary RPGs, King Arthur: Legends Rise breaks away from linear level-based missions and offers players the freedom to roam the levels at their own pace, although it is but an illusion of choice because there‚Äôs really not much to do aside from going to the next destination. Additionally, the proportions of the characters in relation to the environment can be a bit off, with the players appearing larger than the surroundings, reminiscent of early 2000s strategy and RPG games.The auto-walk option provides convenience for those looking to just skip the exploration aspect and jump straight to the objective. As for the overworld, it is teeming with quests, challenges, and adventures.

King Arthur: Legends Rise features a hero collection aspect, driven by the gacha system known as "Lake Avalon." Players have the opportunity to summon heroes of different rarities, ranging from Common to Legendary. Each mythological hero comes with their own backstory, skills, and abilities, providing a diverse roster for players to experiment with.

To further enhance your heroes' power, the game offers a range of equipment, relics, and upgrades. Collect powerful medieval weapons and equip your heroes with gear via an itemization system similar to ARPG games like Diablo. As a gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, grinding game modes, and premium currency. Ofcourse, not everything here is final but I do hope the free to play experience at launch will be as forgiving as it is now.

King Arthur: Legends Rise goes beyond the typical RPG formula by incorporating a city management system, which is a familiar element that has been adapted by other gacha games as well. As players progress through the game, they have the opportunity to rebuild and manage Camelot, the iconic city associated with King Arthur. Upgrading buildings, managing resources become crucial for the development of Camelot and its role in the narrative.

While King Arthur: Legends Rise showcases incredible AAA visuals and captivating gameplay, it is worth mentioning that the performance on the Android version, during the open beta, could benefit from further improvement. I‚Äôve also encountered lip-syncing problems with the characters in their dialogue that took me out of the immersion multiple times. Furthermore, the UI is in a bit of a rough state and is an eyesore to my taste.. However, it's important to note that this is an Open Beta Test and that the developers are actively seeking feedback and working to address these issues before the game's official launch.

Conclusion:

King Arthur: Legends Rise is a visually pleasing upcoming RPG adventure that successfully combines the allure of Arthurian legends with traditional mobile game mechanics. The visually stunning graphics, gritty art style, and attention to detail is outstanding. The turn-based squad battles offer strategic depth, while the hero collection and customization aspects provide a rewarding sense of progression and personalization.
