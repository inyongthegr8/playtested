Limbo Disco is an upcoming free-to-play mobile game that combines elements of roguelike, wave survival, and cartoon aesthetics. The game follows in the footsteps of similar titles Vampire Survivors and Brotato, with its addicting allure entirely playable with one-hand.

Limbo Disco's visuals feel very much like Brotato, 2D with clean color palettes and minimal detail, reminiscent of old flash games from the 2000s but with a vibrant DJ-inspired neon-cyberpunk twist.

Limbo Disco introduces a variety of gameplay mechanics that keep the action fresh and exciting. Players start by selecting a character from a flavorful roster, each with their own unique personality, attack types, and upgradable stats that are upgradable as you progress throughout the game and collect more materials. The attack types are closely tied to the character and their weapon. Additionally, players have the option to bring in up to four supporting characters, essentially forming their weapon pool.

As players progress through the game, they face waves of enemies and challenging boss battles. Defeating enemies fills an experience bar, and when filled enables players to select upgrades from a random selection of three rewards. These upgrades can range from new weapons or modifiers to increased attack speed or damage, empowering players and allowing them to become even more formidable in that specific run.

The levels vary in size and present additional obstacles and hazards as extra challenges, dying enemies may explode, the map can block or damage you in ways that will possibly make it frustrating, it gets increasingly hard on the way to the boss, and the game overall definitely feels more challenging than Vampire Survivors or Brotato. From time to time, you are given chances to heal and recuperate. You can also leave your game and continue it for later, which is a nice quality of life feature even if it has roguelike elements

As a rogue-like game, not everything is reset when you fail a run. There are persistent progress to be made, as especially character systems where you can upgrade characters into different tiers, and the card systems where different kinds of “customer” cards are unlockable, which will give permanent bonuses right from the start of runs that would otherwise be obtainable only as in-run temporary upgrades.

Limbo Disco is planned to be a free-to-play game, as such, it also has many of the usual F2P elements rolled into this game, like an energy system to keep playing, optional ads to continue playing or get additional resource boosts, and gacha mechanics to unlock new characters or perhaps upgrade them to a higher tier. It also has familiar features like login bonuses, tasks and challenges.

While these F2P elements exist, in my experience with the beta, Limbo Disco can be entirely playable without spending money. The game offers a fair balance between free and premium content, and players who embrace the added grind and challenge of the F2P model will find an arguably more rewarding experience. The game's value lies in its gameplay depth and progression systems, ensuring that players can enjoy the game even without making in-app purchases.

Conclusion:

Limbo Disco is an enjoyable mobile game that successfully combines action-packed wave survival rogue-like gameplay with a unique art style and addictive progression mechanics. Building upon the momentum set by Vampire Survivors and Brotato, Limbo Disco adds its own twist to the formula. With its challenging waves of enemies, character upgrades, and the convenience of one-handed play, Limbo Disco is a title that fans of these types of games should definitely keep an eye out for.
