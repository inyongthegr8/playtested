Battle Crush Beta delivers a dynamic gaming experience that merges the thrill of a battle royale with the hero-based gameplay of a MOBA. The current CBT version features a unique cast of 15 Calixers, mythological and legendary heroes with distinct abilities, and playstyles. All heroes are unlocked, so those participating in the beta test can try each hero.

With a fast-paced, shrinking arena, players must fight to be the last one standing in intense 30-player battles. The game's visual style is characterized by simple yet striking graphics, delivering a casual and lighthearted atmosphere.

Players can look forward to engaging but simple MOBA-style combat, with four abilities to use: Light, Heavy, Ultimate, and Dodge; all governed by a stamina system. Matches are short, only around 8 minutes each, and confrontations are quick and decisive. In short, Battle Crush features combat that's easy to pick up but provides frantic, enjoyable gameplay.

As of the current beta test, I found the performance still a bit lacking, and even the game doesn't support my phone's aspect ratio which is pretty standard (seems to be locked to 16:9 only), probably because it is also being developed for the Switch and for PC (Steam), with full cross-play support.
