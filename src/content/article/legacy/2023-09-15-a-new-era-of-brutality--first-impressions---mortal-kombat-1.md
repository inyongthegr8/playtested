When it comes to fighting games, there are three distinct types of players - those who crave for an immersive story, the folks, friends, and families who gather for local multiplayer showdowns, and the competitive souls who venture into the online arena. Well, personally, I fall into the first two categories, and I can confidently say that Mortal Kombat 1 delivers a fatal knockout punch of fun for both camps.

The story is actually surprisingly amazing. Despite being a reboot in most respects, it is still set after the events of Mortal Kombat 11 in a sort of an in-universe reboot. The main campaign only spans around 5-7 hours, but once you start it, you just can’t put it down. It’s THAT Good. It’s one continuous flow of nonstop action, brutality, and a bit of comedy that seamlessly changes from cutscene to fights and back to cutscenes.

Of course, Mortal Kombat 1 wouldn't be Mortal Kombat without its unapologetic depiction of violence. Hits, blood, gore, and dismemberment are portrayed in a graphic and exaggerated manner during battles and this game is no different from its predecessors, with "Fatalities" taking center stage in all their visceral glory.

My only main gripe is the current state of performance for this release. Occasional stutters, and a jarring 30FPS lock for the menus, fatalities, and in-game cutscenes, which could get a bit jarring especially during the campaign mode where the game seamlessly changes from cutscene, to fights, and back to cutscenes. Overall though, it's a great start for a rebirth of a franchise, paying homage to and continuing what's been done and at the same time doing its own thing.
