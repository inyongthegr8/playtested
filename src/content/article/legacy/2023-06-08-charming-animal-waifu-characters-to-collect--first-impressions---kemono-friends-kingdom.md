Blending elements of trajectory-based launching akin to Angry Birds with turn-based RPG mechanics, Kemono Friends: Kingdom offers a slight spin on a familiar gameplay format and it is coming soon with an Open Beta Test scheduled for June 21!

Players must adjust the trajectory of their Friends' launches (on a paper plane) to strategically attack enemies. In general, the game follows a turn-based system, where players make tactical decisions per turn and utilize special abilities called Miracles to overcome adversaries. The addition of the Angry Birds launching system adds a bit of extra engagement for the player, as the levels will include various obstacles, map elements, and floating collectibles for the player to navigate around with.

Kemono Friends: Kingdom introduces us to the player named main character, a human who awakens in Kingdom, a park separate from the famous Japari Park. Stumbling upon the main character are his soon-to-be companions, The Friends — a hybrid of human and animal — Least Weasel and Chevrotain. Together, they embark on a journey filled with battles against the hostile Cerulean creatures. This intriguing premise sets the stage for an exciting adventure as players uncover the mysteries of Kingdom and overcome formidable challenges.

The core gameplay of Kemono Friends: Kingdom revolves around collecting and developing a diverse roster of animal inspired waifu characters simply called “Friends” and progressing in an adventure mode campaign. Each friend has their own Miracle which is their special ability, as well as skills called Habits. You can upgrade and level up these Friends by using materials, and also obtain new ones by playing the game or participating in its gacha mechanics. The process of collecting and developing Friends is rewarding. Acquiring new Friends through gacha pulls and events keeps the experience fresh. Leveling up Friends, equipping them with gear, and unlocking their potential provide a solid sense of progression and accomplishment.

As usual with these types of gacha RPG games, the strategic aspects of the turn-based battles add depth to the gameplay. Players must pay attention to the enemies, consider their Friends' strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities to form effective teams. Balancing team composition and synergy becomes crucial in defeating enemies and progressing through the game. This in turn is heavily affected by the gacha gaming mechanic of the game.
