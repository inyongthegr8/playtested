## ‚ú®Overview
EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24, the latest installment in the longstanding FIFA series ‚Äînow with a fresh name ‚Äî has made quite an impression with its recent release ‚Äî or rather, update today, September 26. 

If you‚Äôre wondering why FIFA Mobile is being rebranded to a new franchise called EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢, It‚Äôs because EA Sports and FIFA revealed last year that their long-standing licensing agreement would come to an end on December 31, 2022.  For existing players of FIFA 23 Mobile, the transition to the EA Sports FC version will be seamless. The game is available as an update on the App Store or Play Store, allowing players to continue their football journey without losing their progress as such as account names and many unlocks and purchases.

For more information about what carries over and what doesn‚Äôt, check further down below towards the end of the Review.


## üé®Graphics
One of the first things that catch the eye when starting EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24 is the graphics. Designed for mobile devices, it manages to deliver impressive graphics and art that rival some console experiences. Player models are rich in detail, and the animations are adequately lifelike, but not without general jankyness.

While it's important to note that it may not match the level of detail seen in the console versions or the next-gen EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ 24, it is undoubtedly a visual spectacle on mobile devices. It‚Äôs not aiming for a hyper realistic graphics, but the details are there and I would say well made.

The developers understand the diverse range of devices on which players engage with the game and have addressed this by offering an extensive graphics customization setting. From Power Saver to Ultra graphics, and the option for up to 60 frames per second on capable devices, they've left no stone unturned in catering to player preferences. Personally, I‚Äôve had no issues running the game on max graphics and frame rate on my Snapdragon 888 machine, even while charging.


## üéÆGameplay
Starting the game, it literally ‚ÄúKicks off‚Äù with a series of training challenges. Before unlocking many of the game modes, the game requires you to complete a fairly swift but helpful set of training challenges, which actually helped me a lot in understanding the game mechanics a bit better. This feature was notably barebones during the beta last month, so understanding the mechanics was easier for me this launch time.


## üïπControls
The touch-based controls in the game are intuitive and responsive, allowing players to execute a wide range of actions with relative ease. These actions include passes, tackles, shots, and skill moves. The game offers multiple control options, catering to different playstyles. Players can choose between virtual buttons or gesture-based controls, ensuring that everyone can find a suitable control scheme that suits their preferences. Just like the graphics, it‚Äôs not aiming for hyper realism and more like aims for a fun arcade experience instead.

Once the initial tutorial challenges were completed, I was free to do my own thing, either by playing one of the two core game modes, or playing the new campaign game mode "UEFA Champions League", which is perhaps is my favorite game mode for the whole game.


## ‚öΩCore Game Modes

EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24 revolves around managing Teams in various aspects, including team customization, player collection gachas, formation strategies, skill moves, player development, and more.  Players collect player cards through packs, events, and the in-game market. As they acquire more player cards, they can improve their starting lineup and overall team rating.

The game features two core game modes to play your Teams in: VS Attack and Head to Head. These modes will feel instantly familiar to fans of the previous FIFA Mobile games, effectively carrying forward the gameplay format into this new era.

VS Attack: This mode provides a real-time indirect battle between your team and the opponents. Both teams rush to score goals against AI-controlled defenders, making matches fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping. The short duration of each half is perfect for quick gaming sessions on the go.
Head to Head: In contrast to VS Attack, this mode offers a direct battle between your team and opponents. Here, both teams compete directly, taking on both defensive and offensive roles against each other in real-time. It's a departure from the indirect style of VS Attack, offering a more hands-on football experience.

## üèÜ The UEFA Champions League campaign

Aside from other returning game modes such as Manager Mode, What truly sets EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24 apart from previous iterations and competitors is the introduction of the UEFA Champions League campaign. This mode takes players on a journey from the Group Stage all the way to the Final. It captures the essence of this prestigious tournament, allowing you to lead your chosen club to glory.

The key highlight here is the inclusion of REAL players with REAL stats. You can take control of one of the qualified clubs, or opt for a non-qualified team, which replaces one of the original clubs in the Group Stage draw. This twist adds a layer of unpredictability to the tournament, breaking away from the traditional club management progression found in other football games.

The introduction of the UEFA Champions League campaign is a refreshing addition that provides a break from the monotony of managing your own club and the grind often associated with "pay-to-win" player upgrades. It's a nod to the diversity of football experiences players seek.


## üíµMonetization
EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24 still features the traditional free-to-play model, offering players the option to acquire virtual currency or packs in exchange for real money. This is a standard practice in free-to-play titles and aims to help in progression and enhance the team by obtaining top-rated players.

The game features lots of moving parts with regards to the game's monetization. With numerous rewards, currencies, and mechanics that might seem overwhelming at first glance. However, past FIFA mobile games have been relatively generous with free rewards, ensuring that players who choose not to spend real money can still enjoy the game. Progression wise? That‚Äôs another story.

Additionally, quests, leagues, events and campaigns provide varied challenges, rewarding players with unique items and players for their accomplishments for even as simple as logging in daily. Still, some players may feel tempted to spend real money to improve their teams.


## üí± Progression transfers from FIFA 23 to EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24
With the update, the progression from FIFA 23 to EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ MOBILE 24 is designed to be seamless, ensuring that players can continue their football journey without losing their progress. Here's how the progression transfer works, what resets and what doesn‚Äôt:
