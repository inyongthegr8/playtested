Tumbling Zoo-rock it, is a consumption game reminiscent of .io games such as agar.io and hole.io where you need to consume food and other players to make yourselves bigger, with the ultimate goal of becoming the biggest player on the map by the timer ends.

The game basically adopts the same formula and adds some new changes to it that makes players put in more work in order to consume other players.

Players can control different kinds of animals (depending on their choice) that are unlockable via various in-game currencies, and some of them will have a different minor difference like stats and attributes, providing variety and some form of added layer to the consumption game format, some are just pure cosmetic

Tumbling Zoo-rock it also features a skill progression system in the form of Zoo that houses animal pens for different types of animals. I noticed four different kinds of pens that divide the roster of playable animals.

Upgrading each pen will result in upgrading the stats and attributes of that animal type. Itâ€™s a very rudimentary zoo management element for now, but it's a nice added flavor for the core IO gameplay.

So far, Tumbling Zoo-rock it is simple and fun. There is a nice twist added to the .io consumption gameplay which makes the game more dynamic and exciting. Unfortunately I could not play a lot more than I wanted because of the energy system, but if you're okay with small bits of gaming from time to time, it probably won't bother you.
