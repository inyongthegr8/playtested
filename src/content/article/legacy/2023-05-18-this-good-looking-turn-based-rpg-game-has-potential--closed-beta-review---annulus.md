## Pros



- High-quality graphics


- Extensive character roster and classes


- Challenging turn-based gameplay## Cons


-Presentation is all over the place

-Poor translation quality

-prolonged unskippable tutorial

ANNULUS is a turn-based tactics game that takes place in medieval times, specifically in Europe during the age of chivalry, but with dark Cthulhu undertones that permeate the narrative and atmosphere.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4, the graphics look stunning and highly detailed, especially for a mobile game standard.  However the presentation seems inconsistent and all over the place, ranging from impressive high production CGI sequences and highly detailed graphics, to a barebones-looking UI and weak story delivery. There is English localization available for the menus and dialogues (without voice-acting), but the translation quality is questionable with numerous instances of murkiness.

In ANNULUS, players assume the role of a regiment commander, navigating the chaotic land of Novusaes. The game involves recruiting diverse characters, engaging in battles against various enemies, undertaking missions, and progressing through the story campaign. The central plot revolves around conflicts that emerge due to religious beliefs and territory between various religious groups and kingdoms.

Starting out the game, the tutorial is quite hand-holding, but it is excessively drawn out and un-skippable. It ensures that players can learn the mechanics easily and slowly, but I would be lying if I didn't admit to some frustration arising from not being able to do what you want for the first hour or so.

The gameplay in ANNULUS revolves around recruiting and upgrading heroes, as well as constructing a well-balanced regiment lineup. Players engage in turn-based tactical battles on a grid-like battlefield, where they can select up to four or so combatants from their squad before the battle starts.

There are three main melee weapon classes used by the characters, such as Guns (Itâ€™s essentially just a Spear but probably poorly translated), Swords, and Axes.  What sets these melee weapon classes apart is the implementation of a rock-paper-scissors weakness system. This means that each class has certain advantages and disadvantages against the others. For example, Guns might be effective against Axes but weaker against Swords, while Swords may have an advantage over Guns but be less effective against Axes.

This system adds a strategic element to combat, requiring players to consider which character to bring out to missions and adapt their playstyle accordingly. Aside from these melee weapons, there are also ranged weapon types like the archer and magic that can do different types of damage from a distance. There is also a separate weakness system for them, but mainly involves unit types. For example, flying units will take more damage from archers.

ANNULUS features over a possible hundred classes for the characters that you can recruit, and the option to jump between different similar classes of the same category. Nightingale, great swordsman, imperial marshal, trickster, doctor, knight, guard, ranger, in what looks like every class permutation you can think of, ANNULUS has it to some degree.

The combat in ANNULUS is engaging and challenging, with characters possessing unique abilities, strengths, and mechanics. A counter-attack mechanism is in place, allowing units to retaliate if the attacker is within range, ensuring that units remain active even during the opponent's turn.

There are different objectives for the missions, such as clearing the level of enemies, killing a single target, or just plain surviving for a definite amount of turns. Failing to complete the objectives within the given conditions, typically 12 turns, or losing all units results in defeat. There are also bonus conditions that result in greater rewards, such as not letting too many units die, or finishing the stage in 5 turns.

There is indeed an auto feature for the combat, but it is only available for the side missions and activities, not for the main campaign. Which is an unfortunate design decision as autoplay is something this game probably needs, with how slow the combat is sometimes. Especially for those with already geared up squads looking for more challenges.

ANNULUS is set to become a free-to-play game; Consequently, the game incorporates premium currency, gacha mechanics for acquiring heroes, a grind-heavy progression system for upgrading them, and utilizes a time-based currency or energy system that restricts gameplay unless players either wait or make in-game purchases.

As far as the beta test goes, ANNULUS has performed satisfactorily for me. Only encountering minor UI and localization issues, long loading times, and my personal gripe with the prolonged and restrictive tutorial section. As a turn-based tactics game, ANNULUS shows promise and has the potential to be a future hit. Since it is still in the closed beta test phase, there is hope that the developers will address and refine the issues encountered, and refine the gameplay and presentation more.

Conclusion:

ANNULUS combines turn-based tactics, medieval themes, and dark Cthulhu influences to create a unique gaming experience. With its tactical combat, extensive character classes, and a blend of squad management and hero collecting elements, the game aims to engage players in a challenging and immersive RPG adventure.
