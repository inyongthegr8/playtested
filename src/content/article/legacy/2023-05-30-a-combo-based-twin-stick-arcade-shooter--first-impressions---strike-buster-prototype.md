Playing Strike Buster Prototype, it definitely reminded me of the retro arcade space shoot ‘em ups I’ve played in my childhood during my PS1 days, such as Ray Crisis and Einhander. However, it blends retro aesthetics with modern gameplay elements such as a physics system and twin stick controls. The game is already available on PC and Switch, but I was able to try out the Android demo version of the game, bringing the arcade shooter into the mobile platform.

The combat system in Strike Buster Prototype centers around combo accumulation, making it a vital component of the gameplay. Players must string together successive kills to build and maintain their combo meter. As combos increase, so does the power of the player's weapon, creating a satisfying feedback loop that rewards precision, consistency, and skill. It's immensely gratifying to see your weapon grow stronger with each successful combo, allowing you to dispatch enemies with even greater efficiency.

The game's weapon type system further elevates the strategic depth. Each enemy — most of the time in groups — has a specific color-coded  weakness to a particular weapon type, requiring players to constantly switch weapons in the heat of combat. This decision adds a layer of tactics and forces players to think on their feet, as they must quickly assess the enemy types they encounter and switch weapons accordingly.

Much like the classic arcade games it pays homage to, Strike Buster Prototype doesn't pull any punches. It challenges players to master its mechanics, learn enemy patterns, and hone their reflexes. Every encounter feels like a nail-biting test of skill, especially with the physics settings in effect when colliding and bouncing around enemies, making victory all the more rewarding. While it may frustrate some players initially, those who persevere will find a deeply satisfying sense of accomplishment as they improve and climb up the high scores.
