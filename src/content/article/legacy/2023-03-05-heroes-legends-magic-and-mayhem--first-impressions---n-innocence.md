N-INNOCENCE is a mobile game that takes you on a journey through a world of heroes, legends, magic, and mayhem. With its gacha-infused side-scrolling RPG fighting gameplay, this game offers a unique experience that is both addicting and exciting. It is currently out now at a limited capacity, for North American Regions only on both Android and iOS.

You find out you are transported into a magical world full of mythological and legendary beings from across human history and folklore, including a female Thor from Norse mythology.

At the start of the game, it immediately presents itself as heavily story-driven, with various visual novel-esque dialogues and storytelling, a common theme in these mobile games. While the story is good, I find these cutscenes far too long and dragged out and the gameplay elements are far spread out in-between them. You can skip it, but you are doing a disservice too by missing huge chunks of the story.

You get to choose up to three fighters from your character pool, and then level them up as you progress through the game. The game does have a nice variety of characters to unlock and choose from, each with their own unique abilities and fighting styles.

The controls are intuitive, and the gameplay is fast-paced and thrilling. You'll use flicks and taps to dodge and attack your opponents, seamlessly switching between your selected fighters to create powerful combos and gain attack bonuses. The Divine Power ability adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, giving you a special attack to unleash when the time is right.

You play through the story chapters in a linear based mission system, with bits of cutscenes inserted in-between. As I said earlier, the overall premise of the story is interesting, but the combat is just too good to happen at few intervals during the early parts of the game.

The 2D artwork is beautifully made — more specifically — tailor-crafted to appease male fans with the sexy character designs — and the 3D cel-shaded graphics during gameplay is up to par. The music is well-composed and feels on the level of quality one might expect from an Eastern RPG game. There is no voice-acting, so be well prepared for a lot of reading for the narrative.

My experience with N-INNOCENCE up to this point is a highly positive one, The premise is interesting, the gameplay is simple but addictive in nature, and it looks good visually; with over-the-top presentation and character designs.
