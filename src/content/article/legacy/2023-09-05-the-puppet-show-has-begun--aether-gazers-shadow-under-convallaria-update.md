Aether Gazer website,

It's a really cool game with real-time combat and action-packed gameplay on top of the hero collecting gacha mechanics, and I highly recommend you try it if you haven’t already.

But what about its new update, 'Shadow Under Convallaria'? Well, to avoid any confusion with the similarly titled upcoming game Sword of Convallaria, Shadow Under Convallaria is actually a limited-time event for Aether Gazer Global, following the previous update last month “Where the Butterfly Belongs”.

The update includes a new chapter in the main story, Chapter 10, eponymously named "Shadow Under Convallaria." Completing normal and hard stages of this chapter will reward players with Shifted Stars. Players can challenge the Chapter 10 Normal stages without having to complete the preceding stages during the 'Shadow Under Convallaria' event, which is neat for those who want to skip right to the event. When the event ends, players will need to complete the previous main story stages to unlock Chapter 10.

However, the most awaited aspect of this update is the introduction of Hades to the game via the Muses Tea Party Scan. Players can also experience and learn the basic operations of the units during the trial. Thanks to the CN version which is about a year ahead in terms of content, we now know that Hades is considered one of the top-tier units in the game, alongside Hera and Hel.

Aether Gazer is currently under maintenance as of writing but is expected to go live later on September 5th at 15:00 (UTC-7) and will run until October 10th. This corresponds to September 6th at 6:00 AM in SG and CN time zones.
