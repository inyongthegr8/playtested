Soccer Manager 2024 - Football
8.1
Sports
Football


## ‚ú®Overview
Soccer Manager 2024 offers a departure from the standard soccer sports video games. Unlike EA Sports FC and eFootball, which focus heavily on controlling the players on the field, Soccer Manager 2024 leans heavily into its title ‚Äì it's all about managing the team. It's like taking on the role of a real-life soccer manager, making critical decisions that shape the destiny of your team. This concept is reminiscent of other 'manager' games like Football Manager 2023 or Basketball Manager 2023.




## Pros
- True sim approach to gameplay
- Tactical Depth
- Club, Team, and Manager customization
- International Team Management## Cons
- Limited Realism in Graphics and Animations



## üéÆGameplay
The gameplay revolves around tactics, transfers, and team management. You're responsible for every aspect of your team's success or failure. From choosing the starting lineup to making strategic substitutions during matches, every decision matters.  Not only in-game but also outside the game. Managing your stadium, promotions, and sponsorships. This is where Soccer Manager 2024 shines ‚Äì it forces you to think like a manager in charge of a soccer organization, not just a player.

Unlike EA Sports FC and eFootball, which offer fast-paced, action-packed gameplay, Soccer Manager 2024 is tactical and methodical. Matches unfold at a pace that allows you to think strategically, you can pause the match at almost any time, looking at the 2D overview of the match. You'll find yourself pondering over each pass, each substitution, and each tactical adjustment. It's a cerebral experience, and if you're a fan of sports management simulations, you'll find it incredibly satisfying even though the visuals aren‚Äôt always in 3D or in a fast-paced action.


## üé®Graphics and Presentation
Speaking of actual 3D graphics, this game still includes them, but they are primarily reserved for highlighting key in-game actions such as scoring goals, successful saves, and intense contact moments. The developers are boasting a graphical engine overhaul, however, the graphics and animations in Soccer Manager 2024 are, to put it mildly, still not its strong suit. While other soccer games strive for realism and meticulous player likenesses, this game seems to rank last in terms of realism and eye candy.

If you thought the graphics were a bit off, wait until you witness the animations. They are comically bad, in a way that might make you chuckle rather than cringe. Players move or rather ‚Äî- slide ‚Äî in rigid, robotic motions that are light-years away from the fluidity of their real-life counterparts. It's as if the players are action figures being played by a bunch of kids. It's evident that the focus here is on strategy and management, not on replicating the graceful dribbles and acrobatic goals you'd see in other soccer games.


## üïπA focus on Team Management and a departure from actual player control
Soccer Manager 2024 proudly stands apart from EA Sports FC and eFootball in its approach to soccer gaming. While EA Sports FC and eFootball prioritize offering an authentic soccer experience, Soccer Manager 2024 takes a more strategic and management-focused route.

One major difference is the absence of direct player control in Soccer Manager 2024. In EA Sports FC and eFootball, you can control players' movements with precision, executing intricate dribbles and stunning goals. In contrast, Soccer Manager 2024 limits your direct involvement to making tactical decisions and substitutions. You watch the matches unfold as if you're a spectator in the stands rather than a player on the field.

Additionally, while EA Sports FC and eFootball feature extensive licensed teams, leagues, and player likenesses, Soccer Manager 2024 leans on generic teams and players, and this year the ability to customize the appearance of your own manager. You won't find every real-life club and superstar here. Instead, you'll be bound to create your own narrative with fictional teams and players. This can be a breath of fresh air for those who are tired of the same old licensed content, and the game feels more personal and customizable as a result. However, the game still allows players to take control of over 900 clubs hailing from 54 leagues across 36 countries around the world. Over 23k+ players have had their stats updated, and 6k+ players have been added to the game‚Äôs overall roster.

In a significant expansion for this year, Soccer Manager 2024 introduces the ability to manage international teams. Now, you can guide your national squad through major qualifiers and tournaments against the best international teams from around the world. This new feature opens up a world of possibilities, allowing you to put your managerial skills against the finest on the global stage.

In Soccer Manager 2024, your ability to strategize, make smart transfers, and build team chemistry takes center stage. It's a game for those who relish the challenge of managing a soccer club from top to bottom.


## üíµMonetization
The core game itself is available for free, allowing players to dive into the world of soccer management without any upfront cost. However, there are in-app purchases in Soccer Manager 2024 that are present but not invasive, such as gold, energy boosts, cash for the team, a bundle of any of these, or buying a ‚Äúpremium version‚Äù. They offer players various options to enhance their experience, but crucially, they don't impose themselves on the gameplay. The game is entirely playable without spending a dime, making IAPs feel more like a compelling choice rather than a necessity. Of course, this still makes the game pay-to-win, as spending money still directly affects the progression.


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
Soccer Manager 2024 might not win any awards for its graphics or animations, but it doesn't aim to compete in those areas. Instead, it carves out a unique space in the soccer mobile gaming genre by focusing on strategic team management. It offers a slower, more thoughtful experience. If you're a fan of soccer management simulations and can overlook the quirks in visuals, Soccer Manager 2024 is a game that will test your soccer team managerial skills.
