Killer Frequency is a first-person horror puzzle game set in the 1980s. Players assume the role of Forrest Nash, a late night radio talk show host on 189.16, “The Scream”, in the small town of Gallows Creek. The game revolves around the mysterious return of the killer known as The Whistling Man, who is causing havoc in the town.

The game takes us to Forrest Nash’s radio station late at night, where you are also tasked with operating the DJ Booth’s controls to play music, operate the phone lines, and perform DJ duties. Forrest Nash starts a new program called “Guess that Scream”, inviting callers to guess a random scream played on the show. However, the situation becomes serious when genuine calls are received from scared characters seeking help, and players must use everything at their disposal, including solving various puzzles, to assist them. The time-sensitive aspect adds tension and a sense of urgency to the gameplay.

These puzzles range from starting cars to guiding characters out of mazes, providing challenges and time-sensitive situations. The majority of the gameplay revolves around making the correct dialogue choices, with some of them being timed. The correct dialogue choices can determine the fate of the callers, providing a compelling narrative aspect to the game. It's both satisfying and nerve-wracking to navigate through these choices, as they directly impact the survival of the residents. The puzzles overall are logical and straightforward, and nothing out of the ordinary is given to the player.

Overall, I can say that Killer Frequency is a unique game that blends storytelling, interactiveness, and playfulness to create a distinct and captivating experience that sets it apart from other titles in the genre.
