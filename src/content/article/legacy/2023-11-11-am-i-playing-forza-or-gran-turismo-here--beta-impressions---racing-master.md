Racing Master is a mobile racing game developed by both Netease and Codemaster and features amazing visuals, presentation, and is loaded with gameplay content. The game is currently on a closed beta test from Nov 9 to Nov 28 for the US region, with a full data wipe afterwards. The official release date is still unannounced.

Graphically, Racing Master stands out as one of the best, if not the best, looking racing games on mobile. The realistic cars and environments, ranging from urban cities to scenic countrysides, contribute to a visually stunning experience. and it does performed relatively well on my snapdragon 888 device. I was able to run the game on medium settings with decent frame rates.

Gameplay wise, it leans towards an immersive arcade experience. Races are short, perfect for on-the-go gaming, and the controls are very accessible for all kinds of players. There are multiple levels of driving assists or accelerate/drift automation options, as well as physical controller support.

The game offers both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Singleplayer involves progressing through story chapters and training drills, while multiplayer focuses on ranked races against real players online. Acquiring better cars and upgrading them are crucial elements for success, introducing a gacha system and in-game purchases. Different cars have varying stats, influencing race performance. I found both game modes equally as enjoyable.

Overall, Racing Master seems to offer a well-rounded racing experience with attention to graphics, gameplay, and customization, making it an exciting title on mobile to watch out for racing game enthusiasts.
