Iron Marines+ is a real time strategy game released for mobile devices originally back in 2017, and has since been ported to PC, and then recently released as Iron Marines+, a version of the game that is exclusive to Apple Arcade, a subscription-based gaming service offered by Apple.

At its core, Iron Marines+ is a classic real-time strategy game that will feel familiar to fans of the genre. Players must build a base, gather resources, and train troops to defeat their enemies. Iron Marines also has hero units that can be upgraded and customized to suit the player's playstyle.

Players can choose from a roster of different heroes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyle. For example, some heroes are designed for long-range combat, while others excel in close-quarters combat. Each hero can be customized with different weapons and upgrades, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences. You start off with one hero, and unlock more as you finish more stages.

In addition to the hero units, Iron Marines+ features a wide range of different troops, vehicles, and supports that players can use to defeat their enemies. From basic infantry units to heavily armored tanks and aircraft, there is a unit for every situation in Iron Marines. Players must carefully manage their resources to build the right mix of units to tackle each level's challenges. Some units can easily switch between other similar types while in the battlefield, providing for some nice tactical layers not seen in other games.

The gameplay in Iron Marines+ is fast-paced and challenging. Each level, and eventually, planet, presents players with a new set of objectives, ranging from simple base-building tasks to full-on battles against alien forces. The game does an excellent job of gradually ramping up the difficulty, introducing new enemies and challenges as players progress through the campaign that spans multiple stages and planets.
