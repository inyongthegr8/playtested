Digimon World: Next Order is the much needed spiritual successor to the original Digimon World and its remake, Digimon World Re: Digitize.

It’s not exactly a new title, but due to platform availability, I haven’t had the chance to play it yet until now , as the game has now been recently ported and released to the Nintendo Switch and PC platforms.




## Pros



## +Goes back to the original Digimon World formula


## +Graphics have aged well


## +Smooth performance


## +Engaging combat system


## +Satisfying gameplay loop




## Cons


-Lack of PC graphics options

-Half-baked keyboard and mouse support

-Steep asking price for a 7 year old game ($60)

I played the original Digimon World back 20 years ago and remember being amazed at being transported into another world and having my very own Digimon story. No digital pet / monster game has given me that feeling ever since, especially that the subsequent games have totally departed from the first game’s formula.

Deja vu premise

In Digimon World: Next Order, players assume the role of a teenage boy or girl (the player can name the protagonist in the beginning of the game) who is transported to the Digital World and must explore and help save it from a state of chaos. Just like the original Digimon World, Machinedramon is once again the source of these problems. The game mechanics involve collecting and training Digimon, battling enemies, and exploring the game world.

New additions with the port

The port is mostly the same game that was released 7 years ago for the PS Vita and PS4 in the following year. But with some minor quality of life changes that are more targeted towards newcomers and beginners.

The most notable addition being the new difficulty mode called the Beginner mode, which puts a cap on enemy strength. This mode makes the game more accessible to new players or those who are looking for a more relaxed and less grindy experience. It also allows players to enjoy the game's story and explore the Digital World without being constantly challenged by difficult battles.

The other feature is the addition of a RUN button, which makes Map traversal and enemy avoidance a lot easier. This is a significant improvement over the original game, as players can move more quickly through the Digital World and avoid enemy encounters if they choose to do so.

Gameplay Analysis

In Digimon World: Next Order, players must navigate the Digital World and recruit Digimon to their team. Once a Digimon is recruited, the player can feed it, train it, and care for it to improve its stats, which determine how well it performs in battle. Different Digimon have different strengths and weaknesses, so players must strategize and choose their team carefully.

This gameplay loop of training your digimon and caring for it is the core progression mechanic of the game, one that is highly addicting, although it can get repetitive and become a grindfest, especially when not playing on beginner mode.

Partner Digimons will inevitably die in time and is a normal part of gameplay, allowing you to start them again as babies and repeat the cycle again, trying out new possible ways to evolve your Digimon, in a rogue-like-esque fashion.

Digimon World: Next Order also features social and pet management mechanics. Players must manage their Digimon's needs, such as hunger and tiredness, to ensure they remain healthy and happy. Players can also interact with other characters in the game world and build relationships, which can lead to new quests and benefits.

Real-time battles!

Battles in Digimon World: Next Order are real-time and take place in the game world, with the player controlling two Digimon at once. The player can issue strategic commands to their Digimon, such as attack, defend, or use special abilities, and the Digimons will automatically battle on their own. During battles, players must monitor their Digimon's health and MP (memory points) and choose actions accordingly.

The combat system is well-designed and engaging, with real-time battles that require strategic thinking, careful planning, and decisive actions. The ability to control two Digimon in battle and to use their unique abilities makes battles more interesting and dynamic.

The visuals and how the battles are presented are also visually appealing and action-packed, especially when using special moves, complete with matching awesome anime-inspired soundtrack.

During battle, the player's Digimon can also undergo Digivolution, which is the process of transforming into a more powerful form. There are various factors that influence which Digimon the player's Digimon can Digivolve into, such as their level, stats, and the number of battles they have won. The Digivolution system is also a fun and exciting aspect of the game, as players can see their Digimon transform into more powerful forms over time.

The “World” in Digimon World

The game world is vast and varied, with multiple areas to explore and discover. Players can encounter NPCs, take on quests, and battle powerful bosses in their journey to save the Digital World. The game also features a day and night cycle, with some events and quests only available during certain times of the day.

Considering the game was originally made for the PS Vita, the game's graphics are still neat and have aged well, with vibrant colors, lighthearted tones, and detailed anime character and creature designs that bring the Digital World to life, even more than before. The game's music is also well-composed and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, especially when in battles.

Technical Performance

While this is an old game and performance isn't a problem, it lacks modern graphics options, the only option being the resolution, anti-aliasing, and depth of field.

It also has disappointing keyboard and mouse support as they did a lazy job in implementing button prompts. While it is still playable with keyboard and mouse, there are no in-game visual prompts for it and they still display Xbox controller icons. Having said that, the performance is indeed smooth and I have no complaints on how it runs.

A 7 year old game for $60

For a port of a 7 year old game title, the high price point is asking a bit too much. Unless you’re a die-hard Digimon fan or someone who hasn’t experienced it yet with extra cash to burn and is itching to play it, I’d recommend waiting for a sale or price drop.

Conclusion:

Training Digimon, battling enemies, and exploring the game world; These elements of Digimon World: Next Order all come together to create a fun and engaging gameplay experience that will take you more than 40 hours to beat.

This is a game that will appeal to fans of the Digimon franchise and those who enjoy creature-raising and role-playing games, as highlighted by the original Digimon World game. I’d recommend waiting for a sale since the launch price is kind of high, but it’s still a great game and perhaps one of the best Digimon games to exist.
