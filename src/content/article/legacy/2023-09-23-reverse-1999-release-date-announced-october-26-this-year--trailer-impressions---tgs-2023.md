The opening scene of the new Reverse: 1999 trailer sets the tone with an impressive CG cutscene, once again showcasing the game's unique and excellent voice acting. Notably, Schneider, one of the prominent Arcanist characters in the trailer, impressively sports an Italian accent.

In line with the established art design of the game, the visuals throughout the trailer are nothing short of superb. The character designs are presented in a soft Anime style, with subtle hints of HD-2D, all set against high-quality pre-rendered CG backgrounds that masterfully evoke the game's atmosphere. Complementing the visuals is the background music, a lo-fi soul piece that perfectly captures the dark and noir tone of the trailer. The overall cinematic quality of the trailer actually feels like a Hollywood production.

The trailer is short and quite brief, showing a quick montage of the backward time-traveling journey players are about to embark on. It offers glimpses of New York being deconstructed, World War 2 scenes, and even the beauty of rain falling upwards. While there's no gameplay shown here, the trailer concludes with one final reveal: the game releases on October 26, 2023!

We do know that the gameplay of Reverse: 1999 is a turn-based RPG heavily driven by its narrative. Adopting a 7DS style of card-merging combat and hero collecting gacha mechanics. This highly anticipated game is only a month away!
