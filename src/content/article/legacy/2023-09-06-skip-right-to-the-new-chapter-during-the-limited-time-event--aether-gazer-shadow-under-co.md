Aether Gazer, the popular hack-and-slash gacha ARPG game for Android and iOS.(Endorsed by the Aether Gazer website, PC is also playable via emulator). It has recently unveiled its much-anticipated update for its global version, titled "Shadow Under Convallaria.", following the previous update last month “Where the Butterfly Belongs”.

Aether Gazer website,

As for the game itself, I reviewed Aether Gaze﻿r a few months ago when it was released globally﻿. It's basically a  hack-and-slash gacha ARPG game available for Android and iOS, with a rather long and compelling, fully voiced narrative. It's a really cool game with real-time combat and action-packed gameplay on top of the hero collecting gacha mechanics (a bit of waifu but there are male characters too), and I highly recommend you try it if you haven’t already.

Limited-Time Event:

Limited-Time Event:

Shadow Under Convallaria isn't just any ordinary update; it's a limited-time event. This means that there's a window of opportunity to participate and reap its rewards.

Chapter 10 - Shadow Under Convallaria:

Chapter 10 - Shadow Under Convallaria:

The update includes a new chapter in the main story, Chapter 10, eponymously named "Shadow Under Convallaria." Completing normal and hard stages of this chapter will reward players with Shifted Stars.

Aether Gazer players will be delighted to learn that they can challenge Chapter 10's Normal stages without the need to complete the preceding chapters during the "Shadow Under Convallaria" event. This accessibility ensures that everyone that is at least level 30* can dive straight into the action. When the event ends, players will still need to complete the previous main story stages to unlock Chapter 10. As players embark on this epic adventure, they'll find themselves immersed in a voiced narrative filled with twists and turns.

Unlocking Hard Stages:

Unlocking Hard Stages:

For those seeking a more challenging experience, the Hard stages in Chapter 10 are also available. However, there's a prerequisite: players must first clear Chapter 9 on Hard Mode. Once the event concludes, players will need to complete previous main story stages to unlock Chapter 10.

The Puppet Show has begun! - Meet Hades

The Puppet Show has begun! - Meet Hades

One of the most eagerly anticipated aspects of this update is the introduction of Hades. Players will have the opportunity to experience Hades firsthand and learn the basic operations of the Modifiers during the trial. Thanks to the CN version which is about a year ahead in terms of content, Hades has earned a reputation as one of the top-tier units in the game, joining the ranks of Hera and Hel. Joining Hades as new content are three more units as part of the Muses Tea Party" Precise Scan:

S-Grade Modifier: Puppet Master - Hades

A-Grade Modifiers: Drowsie - Oneiroi, Radiant Feather - Hera, Shinku - Buzenbo Tengu

Players can catch a glimpse of what's to come by looking at the Chinese (CN) version of the game, which typically enjoys a content lead of about a year. This allows players to plan their strategies and prioritize characters based on their performance in the CN version. It's a valuable tool for making informed decisions in a fast-paced gacha environment.

Sigils are an essential part of Aether Gazer's gameplay, and "Shadow Under Convallaria" introduces two new sigils with unique effects:

Acheron's Obol (3-set effects): This sigil increases your ATK when Divine Grace is gained in battle, stacking up to 3 times. Additionally, when spending Divine Grace, your Crit DMG is boosted for a limited time, with stacking potential.

Feather of the Pacifier (3-set effects): This sigil empowers your ATK and enhances your Rage gain rate when Rage is spent in battle, with stacking effects.

For those hungry for more lore and adventures, the Red & Green event story will be permanently archived in the Side Story. Administrators who have completed this story in the "Red & Green" Limited-Time Event can experience it again and claim rewards.

There are tons of more content coming in the second half of the event, such as the Dance Battle, Scrolls in the Dream, Storm and Farce, and Autumn Fortune. Each with their gimmicks and rewards. For example,  In Dance Battle, Players earn points by eliminating incoming enemies, and the stage rewards are determined by the highest score achieved.  Rewards for this event include 400 Shifted Stars, Sigil Module T3, and more.

Aether Gazer's update model is characterized by frequent character releases, occurring approximately every 2-3 weeks. Players often strategize and save their in-game currency for characters they desire, and this update is looking to be the PRIME opportunity to splurge on pulls.

Shadow Under Convallaria is an exciting addition to Aether Gazer, extending the narrative, adding new challenges, and finally bringing in the highly anticipated Hades. While the game's pace of character releases may seem fast, savvy players always plan their pulls carefully to maximize their gaming experience. If you're a fan of Aether Gazer’s either expansive narrative or perhaps its action-packed hack and slash style of gameplay, this update is not to be missed.

Event Date:

The game is now LIVE starting today and will run until October 10th. It's divided into two parts: Part I (September 5th to September 19th) and Part II (September 19th to October 10th). To participate in the event, you need to reach level 30 or above.
