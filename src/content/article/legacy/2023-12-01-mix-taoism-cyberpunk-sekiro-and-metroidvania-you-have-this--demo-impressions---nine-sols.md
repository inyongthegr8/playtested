I was able to play a short Demo of Nine Sols, an upcoming 2D platformer with souls-lite and Sekiro elements. It's basically a mix of Taoism, Cyberpunk, Sekiro, and Metroidvania, resulting in a title that seems familiar and unique at the same time.

The gameplay seamlessly blends classic platforming mechanics with fast, brutal action sequences, making each encounter a thrilling experience. Move around like in a 2D platformer Metroidvania game, jump, climb, and dash to avoid hazards... or maybe deflect attacks with a well timed parry.

The demo allows us a peek into the first 30 minutes of the game’s story so far. It follows our cat-looking hero Yi and his vengeful quest against the 9 Sols. The early parts of the game are set around a peaceful village called New Kunlun, with ancient-style technology and optimistic primitive humans living in it. As far as the introduction and premise is concerned, it’s a very compelling story that left me wanting for more as soon as the Demo ended after the first boss fight.

Overall, I was genuinely surprised with Nine Sols in terms of its terrific hand-drawn art style and challenging 2D combat, and I can't wait until next year to finally continue the story and see more of the game.
