Looks like the gap or timeline between PC and mobile ports of AAA games is narrowing, as we now have another release on our hands with SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, a 3D platformer game now available not only for iOS but also for Android.

## ‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 8/10


## üìñStory and Premise

The game's premise takes SpongeBob on a journey to fix the chaos caused by an innocent magical mishap. The concept of wishworlds introduces alternate versions of Bikini Bottom, each with its unique twist from Wild West version of Bikini Bottom to Hollywood-esque environment, It's a decent mover for both the narrative and the gameplay, aligning with the recent trend of multiversal stories. Overall, it feels like a special episode from the animated series.


## üé®Visuals and Art

Impressively, the visuals on the mobile port hold up well against their PC/console counterparts. The game retains its cartoonish charm and vivid art style, resembling the animated series closely but transformed from 2D to high fidelity 3D. Even on higher resolution settings, the graphics maintain their quality and indistinguishable from its PC/console counterparts. Sound wise, many of the soundtrack and soundbits are back and the original voice actors are returning as well.


## üéÆGameplay

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platformer that reminded to the golden days of PS1 and PS2 era platforming. The gameplay is reminiscent of classics like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, with SpongeBob navigating platforms, avoiding obstacles, and collecting Jellies. The level design is a standout feature, offering a beautiful rendition of Bikini Bottom with engaging platforming elements and varying ways to traverse platform and obstacles.


## üïπTouch Controls

The touch controls are implemented very well in the game, and you wouldn‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs a port of a PC/Console game. Proper prompts appear on the screen, and the 3D platformer nature of the game is a good fit for mobile phones. This is unlike the last AAA mobile port that I reviewed in Resident Evil 4, which basically slapped a virtual xbox gamepad on top of the screen without any effort. However, there's a slight issue with dialogues, as the slightest mistouch can inadvertently skip minor cutscenes and dialogues. This minor inconvenience can catch players off guard especially when you‚Äôre in the zone tapping the screen during gameplay and then there‚Äôs a sudden cutscenes; the next thing you know, you‚Äôve skipped the cutscene.


## ‚öîÔ∏èCombat

The combat system is straightforward, with SpongeBob utilizing a basic spinning main attack to dispatch enemies most of the time. There‚Äôs other attack types too like the ground pound or flying kick that adds variety to the moves and how you counter different enemy types. The addition of a dodge mechanic adds a modern touch, since its not present in classic platformers. While combat is generally enjoyable, some may find it a bit simplistic, and SpongeBob is generally an overpowered character throughout most of the game.


## ‚è´Progression

The progression system introduces more moves for SpongeBob as the game unfolds; as well as unlocking new alternative universes to explore and alternate SpongeBob characters to meet. You can also buy and unlock SpongeBob costumes to use, but for cosmetic purposes only. Compared to its predecessor, the lack of multiplayer co-op modes is still clearly a missed opportunity. The game could have benefitted from the addition of co-op features, similar to classics like the LEGO games or Shrek 2 on PS2, although it‚Äôs not as needed here in the mobile version.


## üìäTechnical Performance

The technical performance of the mobile port is a mixed bag. The game looks pristine, with impressive lighting that looks almost the same if not the same as its PC/console counterparts. However, there are occasional stutters and crashes, I‚Äôve personally experienced it multiple times, especially when tinkering with the graphics settings while playing ‚Äî there‚Äôs a 50/50 chance that it would crash.

There are no graphics settings aside from a 30/60 fps switch and a base preset of Low to Ultra, and with my iPhone 13, A Epic preset was recommend, in which i turned down to high to have more frame rates. There are quite some stutters even when paying at the lowest settings, but nothing really game breaking and its overall playable.


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake delivers a fun and faithful 3D platformer experience on mobile devices. The touch controls, despite minor quirks, make the transition from PC/console seamless. The game successfully captures the essence of the animated series, with original voice actors and nostalgic sound bits. The price is very affordable at $10 in what was originally $40 for PC/consoles, and it‚Äôs a hell of a deal, considering you can take the game on the go.
