## üìñPremise

Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge immerses players in the dark, dystopian future of the Warhammer 40k universe. It presents a variety of factions, each with its own distinctive playstyle and mechanics that stay true to the tabletop game's lore. This deep connection to the source material is undoubtedly one of the game's strong points. Whether you're a die-hard Warhammer fan or just someone looking for an engaging card game, Warpforge offers an intriguing premise.

The game showcases a range of factions, including the hulking Space Marines, the chaotic forces of Chaos, the brutal Orks, the mysterious Eldar, the ancient Necrons, and the terrifying Tyranids. Each faction feels like a faithful representation of its tabletop counterpart, complete with unique abilities and playstyles. While some fan-favorite factions are understandably missing, the existing roster provides a diverse and satisfying gameplay experience already, with room to grow.


## üé®Graphics and Art Style

In terms of aesthetic presentation, Warpforge delivers solid visuals for a card battler game on PC and especially on mobile. The card art features striking and detailed designs that evoke the grim atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k universe and doesn‚Äôt over do it. It captures the essence of the source material just right.

The game's environments featuring a mix of 2D and 3D elements that are presented in a 2.5D style. This approach distinguishes Warpforge from other card battlers with abstract or static backgrounds. The overall graphics and art style contribute to the immersive Warhammer 40k experience.


## üéÆGameplay

Warpforge effectively implements well-established concepts in the collectible card game genre. The core gameplay revolves around energy management, where players must carefully allocate their energy to play cards. More powerful cards require more energy, and the energy pool increases incrementally and replenishes each turn, resulting in more chaos as the battle wages on. This basic mechanic adds a layer of strategy and entropy as players must make decisions on card selection based on the available energy. Energy is replenished to the current maximum at every turn, so players are encouraged to maximize all their points at every turn.

In Warpforge, the cards in the game are not limited to a single attack stat; they have two: melee and ranged. This dual-attribute system adds a significant layer of strategic complexity to the game. It forces players to carefully evaluate their moves and make tactical decisions based on the positioning and the types of attacks each card in their hand can deliver. For example, If your opponent‚Äôs card has a weak ranged attack, strategically using your unit's ranged attack against it would yield maximum effectiveness.

The diverse range of factions offers a varied and strategic gameplay experience. The factions aren‚Äôt just reskins of each other with different card designs and effects. They fundamentally work differently. Each faction stays true to its lore and tabletop design. For example, Saim-Hann uses spirit stones to save the souls of fallen cards and even summon wraithguards. Another example is the Necrons, with their ability to bring cards back to life.

However, the game isn‚Äôt without its issues. I feel that it still needs more balancing regarding cards‚Äô health points and damages, especially that cards, specifically weak ones are often eliminated as soon as they are played. Since most played cards cannot attack until the next turn, this means that many cards WILL come and go without even doing anything meaningful to the match.

The game is also brutally difficult to master. It took me a lot of losses before I was able to come up with my first win. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that I was already playing with real players even at my first match, that or the starting bots are too advanced for beginners.


## üìäTechnical Performance

Performance-wise, the game is stable and playable, but there are a couple of UI and interface quirks that I've experienced, such as the settings button being on the edgemost part of the screen, which is prone to accidental touches, and dragging cards being a little too sensitive, etc. Nothing game-breaking, and no crashes. The game though is in dire need of QOL(Quality of Life) improvements, such as the ability to skip the opening of booster packs, skipping the dialogue, and perhaps decreasing the timer of turns to help liven up to pacing of matches.


## üìúGame Modes

The game features two main game modes. Multiplayer Mode is the standard game mode where players face off along with their built Decks against their online opponents in head-to-head card battles, it comes with a ranked and unranked game mode.

The other game mode is Draft: players construct their decks from a limited pool of cards. This process requires careful consideration of card synergies, strategy, and the composition of the final deck. Once decks are constructed, players enter battles or tournaments using the decks they've drafted. The opponents have also drafted their decks in a similar fashion. Draft Mode introduces an extra layer of strategy as players must adapt to the cards they receive during the draft, and is probably my preferred game mode, as it adds another layer of strategic and evens up the playing field even more.


## ‚è´Progression

Warpforge introduces a progression system that revolves around faction-specific campaigns that fundamentally function as battle passes. Each faction has its currency, earned through gameplay and continuous matches, and used to progress along a branching timeline AKA a battle pass progrsesion. These campaigns grant rewards, such as booster packs, unique cards, and other in-game currencies. It's a structured system that keeps players engaged and motivated to explore different factions.

In addition to faction-specific currency, there's an earnable currency of pink crystals, which can be used to purchase or upgrade individual cards. Another currency, grey crystals, can be obtained by completing daily challenges and is used for a draft mode with premium rewards.


## üíµMonetization

The presence of a premium currency, Gold, is where the game's monetization strategy becomes apparent. Gold can be used to buy boosters and cosmetics, but they come at a price. Some items like card backs and avatars can be relatively expensive. The game encourages players to spend real money to expedite their progress or access premium items.

Booster packs, crucial for deck building, can be challenging to obtain through free means. Battle rewards might feel a bit stingy, and choosing boosters can result in missing out on other rare items from the battle pass. While there's an option to upgrade to the premium track, it comes with its cost, adding to the overall expense of the game. Still, I would say the free-to-play experience is highly enjoyable and you can find yourself playing a long time even without spending money.


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge is a game that successfully translates the Warhammer 40k experience into collectible card combat. With its unique factions and mechanics that faithfully represent the tabletop counterparts, it is a compelling choice for those looking to try a new card game, and perhaps a must-try for fans of both the franchise and the card battler genre.
