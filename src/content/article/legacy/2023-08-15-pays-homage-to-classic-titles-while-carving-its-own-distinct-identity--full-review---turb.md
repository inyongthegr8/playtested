In a world where mainstream first-person shooters are now focused on hyper-realism, aim down sight mechanics, and the battle royale format, a distinct shift is taking place. Slowly emerging in a small corner of the industry is a haven for those who grew up in the 90s playing FPS games – what we now commonly refer to as "boomer shooter" games.

Following the footsteps of and spearheaded by the last AAA boomer shooter standing, Doom: Eternal, plus indie games like the similarly titled Ultrakill, and Metal: Hellsinger, Turbo Overkill emerges as another entry that pays homage to classic titles while carving its own distinct identity. Developed by Apogee, this cyberpunk-fueled FPS catapults players into a world where augmentation and mayhem intertwine.

Despite the retro looking graphics, Turbo Overkill still amazed me with its art direction and overall visuals. The 90s PC gaming aesthetics, complete with pixelated textures and low-poly models, evoke a nostalgic sensation while integrating seamlessly with modern graphical marvels like modern lighting, effects, and physics. The result is a world that feels nostalgic, modern, and futuristic all at the same time. The neon-soaked streets of Paradise, with towering megacorporation buildings, deliver an authentic cyberpunk atmosphere that captures the essence of the genre.

While not in the realm of winning awards in terms of storytelling, Turbo Overkill weaves a narrative that feels right at home within the boomer shooter genre. As Johnny Turbo, players embark on a mission to save Paradise from the grip of the rogue AI SYN. The story delves into themes of greed and power, adding depth to the neon-lit dystopia.

At its heart, Turbo Overkill delivers a gameplay experience that's as exhilarating as it is intense. The movement system, featuring sliding, dashing, and wall-running, adds a dynamic verticality that complements the fast-paced combat. The controls are extremely responsive, moving the character is such a blast, and It felt like I was in complete control 100% of the time.

The arsenal of weapons, each with its own unique fire modes and modifiable upgrades, caters to a variety of playstyles and all have their own degrees of awesomeness.  Boss fights are dynamic and engaging, with evolving phases and well-integrated enemy waves that offer moments of respite amidst the chaos.

However, the true highlight is Johnny Turbo's signature chainsaw leg—a visceral slide-based melee weapon that's not only a lethal tool of destruction but a crucial source of healing and armor generation, depending on which augment you’ll slap in your character.  Other augments are also available in game that gives the players enhances the player's overall move set and mobility.

The combat system is done so well that I couldn’t care less about the story and other mechanics anymore. It's a high-stakes dance of precision, evasion, and controlled chaos. The relentless pace ensures players are always on their toes, whether players are mowing down enemies with his leg mounted chainsaw or entering slo-mo with Turbo Time, every tool at Johnny's disposal contributes to an adrenaline-fueled experience that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

Aside from its crucial role in combat, the game rewards mastery of movement and strategy even further via platforming elements and secret areas. The wide, multi-level structures of the environments offer abundant opportunities to utilize Johnny's mobility options and reveal hidden treasures. The benefits of thorough exploration extend beyond just achievements, extending to gameplay modifiers and secret levels that contribute to replay value and depth within the experience. However, it's not without its downsides; occasionally, the level design becomes outright confusing, leaving players like myself lost for a good minute or two, or perhaps even longer. This flaw occasionally affects the game's otherwise fast-paced nature.

Conclusion:

Turbo Overkill is yet another exemplary example of unadulterated intensity and indie FPS gaming. I can see why it's currently taking the gaming community by storm, more specifically with its Steam’s overwhelmingly positive ratings. The game builds on the classic shooter formula, remaining true to its nostalgic roots while infusing it with modern gameplay innovations. I find Turbo Overkill to be a compelling addition to the FPS boomer shooter genre, a highly recommended neon-soaked symphony of carnage.
