Takt Op.Symphony combines traditional console-JRPG with mobile gacha live service elements that results in an intriguing musical-themed game filled with storytelling, waifu characters, and role-playing elements. It is currently in a closed beta test for selected regions (Australia. New Zealand, UK) this late April to Early May, and is set to fully release later this year.

In Takt Op, Players will meet a range of different cute waifu characters to build their orchestra, each with their own unique abilities and musical themes. The game features a turn-based battle system where players must strategically choose which characters and abilities to use in order to defeat their enemies. We have the typical healer, defense, and damage dealer character types, just a typical turn-based battle system just infused with musical abilities.

From the moment I started the game, it already looks high quality. From the FMV anime sequences to the fluid animations and special effects the characters and skills have. It is all very well made from an artistic and quality standpoint. The design of the waifu characters are also toned down and not over-exaggerated, and I like this relaxed approach.

I also love the storytelling – the vibe feels very much like a good Anime series – which is no surprise as it is a direct follow up of the amazing Anime series takt op. Destiny as part of a mixed-media project. The anime was released last 2021, and this game is set to release two years later to continue the story — 2023 — after multiple delays. The game is told in multiple chapters and in a visual-novel style format, with small bits of FMV anime sequences in between.

Aside from the gacha system and turn-based combat. There are also various bonus game modes like a dating or relationship building aspect with the characters, beverage making mini-games, various quests, special missions, puzzles, and battle simulator dungeon crawling levels. This game packs a lot of things to do, and is coming out soon this year. I love the concept and the game has potential, and I think I’ll give Takt Op.Symphony a go once it releases.

Full Review of the closed beta test will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
