As a new intern at Roto Force, you’ll go on missions through the game’s variety of worlds and environments, battling different kinds of enemies and bosses.

Roto Force's gameplay mechanics set it apart from other twin-stick shooters. Instead of freely moving around levels, you move around an inverted planet-like environment, reminiscent of a hamster on a wheel, and you must constantly maneuver to avoid enemies spawning at the center. It's a refreshing twist that keeps the action literally centered on the screen.

Aside from moving left and right around the level, the character can also aim and dash around the circle by swiping up with the left stick, and aim with the right stick to shoot at enemies.

During my experience with the early access demo, I had the opportunity to play the first level, defeat its boss, and try out two different weapons.. In the full version, which has now been released this July 18, players can look forward to accessing a total of 9 unique weapons, 30 challenging mini-bosses, and 10 epic bosses. They have also included generous accessibility options to cater to a wide range of players. These options include the ability to slow down the game speed, increase damage output, and even grant infinite health.
