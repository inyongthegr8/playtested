Tron: Identity takes us back to the Tron Universe, in a never before seen world, or server as it might be called – in a puzzle adventure game format where the player’s decisions matter. The players control the detective program Query, tasked to investigate a mysterious event, finding out the whos, whys, and whats.

Immediately from the start, I was hooked by the amazing storytelling and beautiful 2D visual novel art-style with 3D parallax and neon effects. There is no voice acting, and the game is purely read by the player — which is even more impressive that I got compelled by that much.

The storytelling method is akin to reading a novel or a book. With honest to goodness expressive narration that helps sell the scene to the players, dialogues that are well written, giving characters personality and making the plot highly interesting. From time to time, players are given choices that can and will affect the story.

Everything is narrated, the background scenery, the character’s reactions and gestures, even their demeanor is properly communicated to the player. In fact, if there was voice acting, you can probably play this with your eyes closed. The narration and dialogue is that well crafted.

There is a single puzzle element where you need to defrag memories for investigative purposes, to find out what happened. The puzzle element is unique, highly challenging, but ultimately beatable, and you can skip them too as an accessibility feature if you want to focus on the story at hand.

So far, this feels like a very compelling game to play, I was already feeling sleepy when I booted up this game, but the storytelling and intrigue of the game immediately woke me up like a coffee boost would. I'm excited for what's going to happen with my decisions.
