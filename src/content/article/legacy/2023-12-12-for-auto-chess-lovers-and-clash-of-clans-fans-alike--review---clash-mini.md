‚ú®Overview

Clash Mini is Supercell‚Äôs take on the strategic mind crunching auto-chess experience. Set in a Clash of Clash universe, prepare to go to war in dynamic battlefields where miniature armies clash for supremacy, the game offers a unique blend of strategic depth, iconic Clash of Clans characters, and fast-paced gameplay.

As a commander, players collect, summon, and upgrade an army of Minis, engaging in 1v1 battles or diving into the chaotic Rumble mode against seven other players. The game recently released its patch 2.0 that introduces a myriad of new features, with Supercell touting it as the game's most significant update to date.

For newcomers like me, I have no idea about many of the inner workings of the new patch, so I will be describing the game at face value, without no prior knowledge or baggage from previous versions, except for the recent patch notes.

The game is currently still on a ‚Äúsoft-launch‚Äù with availability in limited countries only (Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong (China), Iceland, ,Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sweden, The Philippines, The United Kingdom)


**Pros:**


+Charming visuals taken from the Clash of Clans universe
+Strategic auto-chess gameplay with some cool twists
+New update revamps the game with many new features
+Smooth performance and blazing fast loading times


**Cons:**


-Temporarily removes some game modes with the new patch
-Minor pay-to-win elements that will only be pronounced in higher rank levels of play

‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 8/10

üé®Graphics and Art Style

Probably a lot of people now already knows about the Clash of Clans universe, and this game builds upon this gaming verse and maintains the same thematic elements in the art style and visuals if only a little more vibrant. It still features the whimsical character designs we all know but in miniature form. The game‚Äôs visuals was actually updated with the 2.0 patch and made the graphics more modernized, HD, and vibrant looking, very timely if you are a newcomer or a returning player.

üéÆGameplay

At its core, Clash Mini revolves around summoning and strategically placing Minis to win its auto-chess like battles. You build your deck of minis beforehand, collecting and upgrading them through various means like grinding or spending money in the store.

The game's accessibility makes it easy for players to grasp the basics quickly, but the strategic depth ensures a challenging learning curve. Players can choose either 1v1 battles and the Rumble mode against multiple opponents caters to both casual and competitive players.

‚öîÔ∏èCombat

Players strategically place their Minis on an 8x5 board, predict their opponent's moves, and watch the miniature mayhem unfold. The real-time battles are under five minutes each, so the matches are quick and bite-sized. The minis actually move across the blocks one by one like in a chess match, instead of moving freely like in other auto-chess games. Players can upgrade Minis during battle by summoning duplicates, and activate stronger abilities to turn the tide. Some matches have special tiles them, like a launchpad to instantly bring a unit to the far side of the map, which makes matches more dynamic and interesting, with regards to how players usually use melee and ranged units.

The gameplay is very strategic; at first, I had no idea what to do and just randomly placed units as I saw fit. But then as I played more and more matches, I learned more and started to instinctively knew what to do with what units, and it become more and more fun and intense as I played; especially in close matches where you win with just one unit and 1 hit left in its HP. There is some luck involved still and a bit of pay-to-win, but for the lower ranks and those just looking to enjoy a decent auto-chess, the game is excellent.

‚è´Progression

The progression system in Clash Mini is designed to provide players with a rewarding journey as they navigate through the game. Players earn rewards through various in-game activities, such as completing quests, winning battles, and participating in events. These rewards include new Minis, skins, and other cosmetic items. As players accumulate victories, they progress through different ranks, such as from Silver to Gold. The typical live service hallmarks are present, such as a Battle Pass called Mini Pass and a Gacha system called Toy Machine to get some pretty cool skins.

üì≤Patch 2.0 Summary

Summarizing the patch notes, Clash Mini 2.0 adds 13 new Minis, including the formidable Battle Machine hero. The game now features Classes, categorizing units and activating special effects when using 2 or 4 units from the same class in a battle.

Rumble becomes a 4-player draft, and cosmetic progression takes center stage with emotes, avatars, and battle highlights. Skin Series and boards are introduced alongside a departure from stat level ups, making progression purely cosmetic.

The Hero Promotions system allows unlocking strategic choices during battles, and heroes can be repositioned once per game. The update also includes a visual overhaul, a Toy Machine (Gacha) for special units and skins, and the temporary removal of puzzles and raids in favor of a Battle Log. The Mini Pass (Battle Pass) undergoes simplification, relying on quests for steady progress

üìäTechnical Performance

Overall, the game performed very smoothly on my Snapdragon 888 device, without any crashes or performance drops. The game actually loaded very fast as if I was playing on PS5. Even the matches load up very fast and queues up very quickly, as of this writing, probably due to the influx of new players coinciding with the new patch. Battery life is also great, you can play for hours on end without even depleting your phone‚Äôs battery. If playing for quick five minute bursts, battery use is negligible.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Clash Mini is Supercell‚Äôs another step into dominating every popular genre in the mobile market. Now, it is trying to break into the auto-chess land with its charming visuals, strategic depth, and accessible gameplay, and it will probably succeed. Clash Mini offers an excellent gaming experience for Auto-chess lovers and Clash of Clans fans alike.
