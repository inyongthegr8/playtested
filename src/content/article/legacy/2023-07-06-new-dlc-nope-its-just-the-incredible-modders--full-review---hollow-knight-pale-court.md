Hollow Knight is an extraordinary metroidvania game that has captivated players with its mesmerizing world and challenging gameplay. Developed by Team Cherry, it combines elements of exploration, intense combat, and atmospheric storytelling to create an unforgettable gaming experience. It was released last 2017 to overwhelmingly positive reviews with sadly only one DLC being released a year after.

In the game, players take control of a nameless knight armed with a versatile weapon known as the nail. The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, allowing players to engage in intense 2D battles against a wide variety of enemies and towering bosses. Aside from jumping, slashing, and dashing, the player can also unlock and perform a variety of abilities and moves as they progress through the game. Artwise, Hollow Knight features a stunning hand-drawn art style that exudes both beauty and melancholy. The haunting color palette and atmospheric lighting enhance the immersive experience.

Over six years later and crafted over the course of more than three years by a collaborative effort of over 50 dedicated modders, a new fan-made DLC called Pale Court breathes new life into the immersive world of Hollow Knight. With its stunning new boss fights, captivating music, expanded charms, faithful art direction, and some bonus secrets, Pale Court promises to capture the essence of the base game while offering a challenging and memorable extension of the Hollow Knight experience. This fan-made DLC takes place after the events of the main game, requiring players to have completed the main story before venturing into this new content.

The main focus of the mod is in its five new boss fights, featuring The Five Great Knights. These formidable adversaries offer intense and thrilling encounters that rival the base game's most iconic battles. Each Great Knight possesses unique attack patterns and abilities, requiring players to adapt their strategies and master precise timing to emerge victorious. The meticulous design and attention to detail put into these boss fights by the modders is commendable, and if you were to show them to any other Hollow Knight players without revealing that it's a mod, they would believe it to be new content made by the developers themselves.

In addition to the enthralling boss fights, Pale Court introduces a selection of new charms, along with four additional charm slots. Pale Court also introduces a fresh musical score that seamlessly integrates with Hollow Knight's original soundtrack, as well as the new artwork with direction faithful to the original game. The new enemy designs and boss sprites blend seamlessly into the existing world of Hallownest. It’s almost as if this mod is actually part of the game, you literally cannot tell from the looks alone.

Pale Court's difficulty level (the added boss fights) matches or even surpasses that of the base game. The modders have expertly crafted encounters that once again, push players to their limits, demanding precise timing, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking. Each boss fight presents a unique and engaging challenge, testing the player's abilities and forcing them to adapt their approach. Even in the first boss, It took me countless times before I was able to conquer it. It was never too unfair or too unreasonable, you just need to master its attacks and timing to be able to beat it. The resulting satisfaction from beating these bosses is just as satisfying as the bosses from the base game.

With Hollow Knight: Silksong, the highly anticipated sequel still on the horizon, Pale Court arrives as a timely gift for fans eagerly awaiting its release, that is if you are playing on PC. But who knows? With the help of the developers, we might be seeing an official release to consoles as well one of these days.
