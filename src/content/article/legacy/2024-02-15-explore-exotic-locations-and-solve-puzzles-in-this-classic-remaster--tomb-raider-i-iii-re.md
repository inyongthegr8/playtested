A modern yet conservative and impressive remaster | Review - Tomb Raider I-III Remastered
https://www.taptap.io/post/7009626

As the classics, Tomb Raider I, II, and III follow the intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft as she embarks on daring expeditions to uncover ancient artifacts and solve mysteries. In this classic trilogy, players will explore exotic locations, solve intricate puzzles, and face off against formidable foes, all while unraveling a narrative that blended mythology, history, and adventure.

There is no handholding, just like the classic experience. No quest markers, no mini-maps, and no waypoint guidance. The only "modern" feature added to guide players are the optional "Action Indicators," where all interactable items will have an exclamation point on them when nearby.

With a single button, players can seamlessly switch between retro and modern visuals. However, this feature is more of a novel addition to allow players to compare and appreciate both visual styles, rather than serving as an outright avenue to play the game in retro mode.
