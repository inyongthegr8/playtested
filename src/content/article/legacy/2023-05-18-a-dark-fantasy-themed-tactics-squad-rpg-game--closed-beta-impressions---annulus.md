ANNULUS is a turn-based tactics game that takes place in medieval times, specifically in Europe during the age of chivalry, but with dark Cthulhu undertones that permeate the narrative and atmosphere.

In ANNULUS, players assume the role of a regiment commander, navigating the chaotic land of Novusaes. The game involves recruiting diverse characters, engaging in battles against various enemies, undertaking missions, and progressing through the story campaign. The central plot revolves around conflicts that emerge due to religious beliefs and territory between various religious groups and kingdoms.

Starting out the game, the tutorial is quite hand-holding, but it is excessively drawn out and un-skippable. It ensures that players can learn the mechanics easily and slowly, but I would be lying if I didn't admit to some frustration arising from not being able to do what you want for the first hour or so.

The gameplay in ANNULUS revolves around recruiting and upgrading heroes, as well as constructing a well-balanced regiment lineup. Players engage in turn-based tactical battles on a grid-like battlefield, where they can select up to four or so combatants from their squad before the battle starts.

ANNULUS features over a possible hundred classes for the characters that you can recruit, and the option to jump between different similar classes of the same category. Nightingale, great swordsman, imperial marshal, trickster, doctor, knight, guard, ranger, in what looks like every class permutation you can think of, ANNULUS has it to some degree.

The combat in ANNULUS is engaging and challenging, with characters possessing unique abilities, strengths, and mechanics. A counter-attack mechanism is in place, allowing units to retaliate if the attacker is within range, ensuring that units remain active even during the opponent's turn.

ANNULUS is set to become a free-to-play game; Consequently, the game incorporates gacha mechanics for acquiring heroes, premium currency, a grind-heavy progression system for upgrading them, and utilizes a time-based currency or energy system that restricts gameplay unless players either wait or make in-game purchases.

As far as the beta test goes, ANNULUS has performed satisfactorily for me. Only encountering minor UI and localization issues, long loading times, and my personal gripe with the prolonged and restrictive tutorial section. As a turn-based tactics game, ANNULUS shows promise and has the potential to be a future hit. Since it is still in the closed beta test phase, there is hope that the developers will address and refine the issues encountered, and refine the gameplay and presentation more.
