Somnolent: Action RPG Fantasy
5.9
RPG
Adventure

The eponymous Somnolent is a world called the dreamcatcher where the game is also set. It is a place where good dreams pass through, while bad dreams get stuck. In layman's terms, Somnolent functions as a filter. This requires the dreamwalkers — warriors summoned to defend dreams — to constantly purge Somnolent of the bad dreams that get trapped in the lands and the nightmarish monsters spawned by them.

The gameplay features a third-person action RPG perspective, where the character possesses basic attack, dodge, and jump abilities to navigate the environment, including subtle platforming elements.

Additionally, the player can utilize various skills that are determined by the equipped weapon type, effectively determining the character's class. These classes range from dual-wielding rogues to sword and shield wielding warriors, and even one-handed sword warriors. Switching classes is as straightforward as changing the equipped weapon set.

After the introduction to the Somnolent village, the game presents us with some fetch quests that aid us in getting started, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the mechanics and the flow of the game, gather materials, eliminate local fauna, and engage in conversations with the villagers.

The combat shows a lot of promise with its flashy special effects, third person action, and a diverse range of skills., but it currently needs a lot of work to be able to provide an enjoyable experience to the player. Despite having sleek animations, the combat system feels clunky and unresponsive.

Frequent stuns and staggering mechanics frustratingly impede movement, while the touch controls often lack responsiveness. Furthermore, the camera occasionally drifts to unintended directions for some reason, further hindering the overall combat experience.

Somnolent performed poorly on my 2018 flagship Android phone. Although there was a slight improvement in performance on my 2020 flagship tablet, it still fell significantly short compared to similar scope games, with occasional crashes and long loading times. It is safe to say that this game is probably best played — for now — on newer and more powerful devices to fully enjoy the experience.

I really want to enjoy Somnolent, the premise is great, the idea of the combat looks solid, but it is currently filled with many issues that hinder the overall experience. For now, it needs a lot of work.
