Warhammer 40,000: Darktide

Action

Warhammer 40K: Darktide has now been released on Xbox, accompanied by a plethora of updates with Patch #13 that transforms it into what feels like an entirely new game. Xbox players who are joining the fray later shouldn't feel left behind or delayed, for lack of a better word. In fact, you can say that its 10 months on PC was just the early access period, so yeah, thanks PC beta testers.

When I reviewed Warhammer 40,000: Darktide last year, I already had fun with the game and touted it as a reasonable Vermintide attempt on the Warhammer 40,000 franchise. However, there were glaring issues during release, such as poor performance and a very repetitive gameplay loop that was only forgivable by its four-man co-op nature.

‚ú®Overview
Before we dive into the specifics of Patch #13, let's set the stage by introducing Warhammer 40K: Darktide for those who are new to the game. This title is set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, a dystopian future where humanity is locked in an unending war against alien species, heretics, and demonic forces. The game plunges you into the underbelly of this grim future, where you play as a member of an Inquisition strike team sent to investigate the mysteries and threats lurking beneath the hive city of Tertium.

üéÆGameplay
In Darktide, you'll join forces with up to three friends or AI-controlled allies, forming a squad of relentless warriors. Your mission is to descend into the depths of the hive city, battling hordes of grotesque enemies, uncovering secrets, and unearthing the horrifying truth that awaits you. The atmosphere is oppressive, the enemies are nightmarish, and the stakes are as high as they come.

Darktide is all about cooperative, first-person shooter action. Similar to titles like Left 4 Dead, Warhammer: Vermintide, or the much more hardcore co-op game GTFO. The game thrives on teamwork, requiring you and your squadmates to work together to survive the relentless onslaught of enemies. Each character class brings unique abilities and roles to the table, from the spellcasting Psyker to the heavy-hitting, gigantic Ogryn.

‚öîÔ∏èCombat
The combat is visceral and intense, with a wide variety of weapons to choose from, each with its own distinct feel and utility.  Darktide‚Äôs gameplay has an amazing dynamic between gunplay and melee combat. Both are executed splendidly, but the melee combat still shines. The gunplay did not completely depreciate the value of melee combat, it merely enhanced it.

You'll quickly realize that this isn't a game for the faint of heart. Darktide excels in immersing you in its dark and dangerous world, and every decision you make, every shot you fire, can mean the difference between life and death. The gameplay is unforgiving, but it's this challenge that makes the victories all the more satisfying.

üõ†Ô∏èThe Class Overhaul
Now, the game wasn‚Äôt universally praised at launch, mainly due to its optimization and repetitive nature. However, Patch #13 brings about the much-anticipated "Class Overhaul", which brings more engaging content into the game. This update is a game-changer, not just for existing players but also as a first impression for newcomers.

The most significant change in Patch #13 is the replacement of the Feats system with Talent Trees. Each character class now has its Talent Tree, and as you level up, you earn Talent Points. You can allocate these points to unlock and enhance abilities and passives within your Talent Tree.

Every character begins with Baseline Abilities, including Blitz and Aura, which can be modified or upgraded through the Talent Tree system. This means that from the outset, you have a unique character, and as you progress, you can shape them to your liking. This level of customization adds depth and replayability to the game, as you experiment with different builds and strategies. Overall, the flexibility here is incredible and was never possible before, allowing you to actually tailor your character to your preferred playstyle.

üíæWhat about old builds?
Fatshark has ensured that the old builds created through the Feats system are still possible. They have integrated former Feats into the individual Talent Trees, allowing you to recreate those beloved playstyles while exploring the new possibilities the Talent Trees offer.

üìäPerformance
Well, compared to my experience around the launch, the performance has improved significantly running on my same setup of i7-8700k and RTX 3080. However, there are still minor stutters when looking around or loading new textures. The Xbox Series X version on the other hand offers both 60FPS performance and a 30FPS quality mode. The Series S version is locked to 30FPS only.

üößThat and more
Patch #13 isn't just about Talent Trees; it also introduces extensive balance changes. Characters and enemies have been adjusted to ensure a more engaging and challenging experience. Weapons have been fine-tuned based on community feedback, enhancing the overall combat feel. I previously complained about how guns are underwhelming and lack stopping power, it seems that that issue for me is gone now.

Beyond gameplay changes, Patch #13 addresses hundreds of bugs and even adds new narrative flavors such as new cinematic cutscenes, ensuring a more enjoyable and immersive gameplay and narrative experience. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements, such as the revamped controller options section, make the game more accessible and user-friendly.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
While Patch #13 is a monumental update, it's crucial to understand that Darktide's appeal extends beyond gameplay mechanics. During launch, the game already excelled in creating an atmosphere of relentless tension and dread. The Warhammer 40,000 universe is renowned for its dark and gritty aesthetic, and Darktide captures it perfectly. Now, combining that with almost a year's worth of refining the game mechanics makes it a must-try for anyone looking for an intense and rewarding co-op experience, EVEN if you have already played Darktide at launch and stopped.
