Gameplay

Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is a real-time strategy sandbox simulation game of medieval siege warfare. The title itself serves as a description of the game, although the phrase "Extremely Realistic" is somewhat exaggerated and meant in a lighthearted, humorous manner.




## Pros



- Physics-based combat that is both entertaining and engaging


- Variety of gameplay modes: multiplayer, singleplayer, co-op


- Challenging variety of missions and keeps players engaged## Cons


-Frustrating control issues, with the camera and selecting units

-May not run well on average phone specifications

With its physics-based combat, humorous tone, and challenging scenarios, Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator offers a combination of strategy, puzzle solving, and sandbox entertainment. Prepare to build your army, construct siege equipment, and lead epic battles in this medieval world of strategic conquest. Originally a PC game (which is still in Early Access on Steam), I was able to play the Android demo version of Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator, which is coming soon.

The game's focus on exaggerated realism shines through its physics-based combat. Watching the battlefield come to life with units subject to the laws of physics and ragdoll is both entertaining and engaging. The comical and sometimes unpredictable outcomes of battles add an enjoyable touch, bringing a lightheartedness to what could otherwise be a serious strategic experience.

The game features basic character models and visuals that somehow align with the game's lighthearted nature and contribute to the overall playful atmosphere.

It employs a stylized visuals approach with a focus on simplicity and approachability.

Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is essentially a real-time strategy game, where players can deploy units, command them in battle, and even assume control of them via third person view. The main focus of the game is siege warfare, and puts players on siege missions against a variety of AI defended fortresses.

In the demo version Iâ€™ve played, it offered a set of single player tutorial missions that introduce players to different scenarios and map layouts. Each mission focuses on teaching players specific gameplay mechanics or strategies, such as using ladders, building platforms, activating soldier abilities, or conducting full-blown sieges.

This approach allows players to gradually learn and familiarize themselves with the game's mechanics while experiencing a taste of the addicting puzzle-solving and strategic decision-making. In the Early Access PC version, players can expect an extensive selection of over 40 single-player levels that align with this engaging gameplay style.

In the demo version, there are several other modes seen, such as Encounter, which can be described as a Skirmish edition of the game. In this mode, players have the opportunity to purchase units and items instead of them being predetermined. Additionally, there is the Sandbox mode (disabled in the demo), which grants players the freedom to build their own levels. Lastly, the Multiplayer mode features a unique selection of maps and game modes, including PvP, versus bots, and co-op survival. Unfortunately, I was unable to test the multiplayer mode in the demo due to the lack of available online players.

The depth of strategy in Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is simple but dynamic thanks to its physics based system. Each scenario and map layout presents unique challenges that require careful planning and tactical decision-making, made unpredictable by the physics system. Whether it's utilizing siege equipment, stacking platforms on top of each other to create a backdoor entry, coordinating unit movements, or exploiting enemy weaknesses, the game offers a wide range of strategic options. The ability to directly control soldiers in third-person mode adds a layer of immersion and personalization to the gameplay.

However, the game falls short in its implementation of touch controls and camera responsiveness. Pinpoint selecting objects on the map and issuing direct commands can be frustrating, hindering the overall experience. The floaty camera controls and inconsistent panning and zooming further dampen the gameplay fluidity. These control issues need to be addressed to enhance the overall enjoyment and playability of the game. It also performed unsatisfactorily, even on my Snapdragon 888 Android device, suggesting that it may not be fully playable on average phone specifications.

Despite its control shortcomings, Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator is a solid and entertaining experience for fans of strategy and medieval warfare. The blend of puzzle-like scenarios and strategic decision-making keeps players engaged, while the physics-based combat injects a sense of fun and unpredictability. With further improvements to the controls, this game has the potential to become a standout in the physics-based warfare simulator genre.

Conclusion:

Extremely Realistic Siege Warfare Simulator feels like a compelling game to play for its strategic gameplay, physics-based combat mechanics, and challenging scenarios. It is a worthy addition to any sandbox warfare simulator enjoyer, provided that the developers can fix the major control issues.
