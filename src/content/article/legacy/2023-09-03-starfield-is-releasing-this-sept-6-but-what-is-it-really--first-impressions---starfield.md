It's created by the same makers as Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,  Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4. So, if you've enjoyed any of those games, there's a good chance you'll like this one, especially if you're a fan of space exploration and space-themed titles like No Man's Sky or Star Citizen.

In Starfield, players take on the role of a character in a futuristic science fiction universe. They can explore various planets, space stations, and engage in a wide range of activities, including branching dialogues with NPCs, skill checks, side quests, looting items, and more. The game allows players to customize their characters and their own ships, which serve as a central element of the game's customization.

Graphics and Overall Art:
Starfield has an overall impressive graphics and a world that feels alive. The highly detailed graphics and magnificent soundtrack contribute to a sense of immersion, wonder, and believability within the game's universe.

Story:
There is a compelling main story involving mysterious artifacts and the Constellation faction, that takes you on an adventure throughout the cosmos, although it's not mandatory to follow, and players have the freedom to explore and take on various missions.

Gameplay:
I would describe Starfield as a quintessential space open-world(s) RPG, offering a vast and expansive play area that includes not only planets but also outer space. Players can explore on foot, visit cities, planet surfaces, and ship interiors, engage in branching dialogues, complete side quests, and loot items. The game supports both first-person and third-person modes, and can be switched seamlessly while at play.

Space Travel: Players can own and pilot their own ships, explore space, and even engage in space combat with customizable ships that serve as extensions of their characters.

Planetary Surface Exploration and Outpost Building: Similar to Fallout's settlement system and No Man's Sky's planetary exploration, players can establish outposts on unexplored planets -- over a thousand of them --- scan for lifeforms and points of interest, and extract resources. Outposts can be linked to establish trade routes, and both ships and outposts can be manned by recruited crew members.

Character Customization: Starfield allows for extensive character customization, including backgrounds, traits, and skills that can impact gameplay.

Skill Progression: The game features a skill progression system where players earn skill points to unlock new abilities and can further enhance those skills by completing associated challenges.

Ten years later, I can see this still being played by thousands, perhaps millions of players (add me to the list) just like Skyrim, Fallout, and Oblivion before it. So far? I'm very impressed by this game, and even more excited for the modding community to do its thing.
