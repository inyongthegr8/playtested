## Cons


-Minor UI gripes

Bright Reappear is an intriguing fusion of the popular Candy Crush match-three puzzle system and retro-style turn-based RPG gameplay. While these both addicting genres have rarely been combined in the past, this game brings its own unique twists to the table.

The graphics of Bright Reappear takes us back to the 80s and 90s era of PC gaming, showcasing a retro art style that evokes nostalgia and an adventurous atmosphere reminiscent of classic games from the past — now in mobile phone horizontal layout. The accompanying sound design perfectly complements the visuals, with low-fi atmospheric tracks that enhance the mood and immerse players in the experience.

The story is pretty simple. Bright Reappear is set in the continent of Oslo. The land, which has enjoyed centuries of peace, is suddenly consumed by darkness, posing a dire threat to its very existence. As players assume the role of the hero originating from the southern region, it becomes our duty to confront these menacing monsters and bring back light and hope to the entire continent.

Bright Reappear features six playable hero characters, with two heroes: “Warrior” and “Thieves”' already unlocked from the start. Each of them have their own distinct talents and skills that are affected by the match-three combat style system. I was able to play the demo version before, and this game is mostly the same with minor changes, only now with complete 12 chapters divided into levels and featuring up to 50 different enemies and bosses, the overall feel of the game feels incredibly satisfying as far as match-three gaming is concerned.

When it comes to gameplay, Bright Reappear immerses players in a unique experience where they watch their hero go through side-scrolling levels and engage in thrilling one-on-one(one at  a time) battles with a variety of monsters. The combat mechanics adopt a traditional turn-based approach, but with a clever twist: instead of directly selecting actions, players must solve match-three puzzles to unleash a range of different actions with varying intensities. This unique gameplay mechanic is highly addicting, as with the nature of match-three puzzle gameplay style.

The core gameplay of Bright Reappear revolves around matching four icons: sword, book, potion, and gold. By strategically matching these icons in groups of three or more during battles, players trigger corresponding actions such as attacking, healing, earning gold coins, defending, or gaining additional moves. The mechanics of match-three games naturally lead to combos, and Bright Reappear is no exception. Whether intentionally planned or haphazardly made, combos unleash powerful combo attacks and impressive moves enacted by player character, resulting in flashy action-packed moments.

Bright Reappear introduces innovative twists to the match-three formula, offering players the freedom to move multiple pieces simultaneously,  depending if they have enough action points. These multi-piece moves, restricted to the same direction, provide a dynamic and fast-paced gameplay experience, setting it apart from traditional match-three games. Additionally, the strategic element is further enhanced by the freedom to move pieces without much repercussions aside from spreading negative effects on icons, even when no three-matches are immediately available, allow the player to the stage for bigger and more rewarding combinations. Despite an unlimited number of moves, players must carefully manage their characters' health points, as well as the spreading negative effects, while facing relentless enemy attacks, adding a layer of tactical decision-making to the gameplay.

The puzzles in Bright Reappear are not only about matching icons, but also feature various spreading negative effects that pose additional challenges. Spreading vines impede movement and require matching to eliminate, while weak stats on icons introduce negative effects that can only be resolved by careful puzzle-solving. These obstacles add some crucial depth to the turn-based combat, forcing players to think strategically and adapt their puzzle-solving approach to overcome these hurdles.

In addition to obstacles, powered-up icons bring an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay. By matching specific icons, players can activate powerful abilities in various forms, such as exploding all icons of the same type or triggering blasts with a specific square radius, vertically, horizontally, and more. These power-ups provide moments of satisfaction and allow players to unleash devastating attacks, turning the tide of battle in their favor.

Bright Reappear incorporates RPG mechanics, granting players the opportunity to acquire different weapons, armor, and accessories as they progress through the levels. The presence of gems adds further depth, as they can be used to enhance items and improve the hero's capabilities. Additionally, the gambling game mode offers a fun side activity, allowing players to test their luck and potentially amass additional gold coins.

One minor issue that persists from the demo to the full release is the user interface (UI), particularly the darkening of icons during moves. While the intention is to help players focus on the action above—an understandable concern, as the puzzles can be quite absorbing—it momentarily disrupts the strategic element and can lead to a sense of disorientation. The option to disable the darkening effect would have been a welcome addition, allowing players to customize their experience and maintain their strategic focus uninterrupted.

Conclusion:

Bright Reappear offers a refreshing and engaging experience, combining the addictive nature of match-three puzzles with compelling turn-based combat. The unique blend of genres, strategic depth, and the satisfaction of executing powerful combos make it a standout title in its genre. Despite some minor UI concerns, the game successfully delivers on its promise of a unique and enthralling adventure. Bright Reappear is not very deep as an RPG game, but as a match-three game, it is truly one of a kind.
