Dragonheir: Silent Gods is an immersive high-fantasy RPG available on both PC and mobile platforms, offering players a captivating narrative, engaging role-playing elements, and strategic tactical combat. Set in a universe where chaos and order clash and gods and mortals are intertwined, the game invites players to embark on an epic journey with choices that influence the fate of this fantastical realm.

The plot unfolds in a manner reminiscent of a finely crafted fantasy novel or Dungeons and Dragons campaign, with layers of complexity and revelations that keep you guessing. With its ability to surprise and subvert expectations, creating an engrossing narrative that continually evolves. It's a story that grows in depth and complexity as you progress, with twists and turns that will leave you pondering the true nature of chaos and destiny.

Dragonheir: Silent Gods offers a gameplay experience that's both immersive and captivating. The core gameplay mechanic revolves around dice rolls and role playing, which players use to influence their actions, whether it's in combat, trading, persuasion or stealing. This dice-based system adds an element of randomness and excitement to every in-game situation.  The entire semi-real-time tactical combat is automated and can be fast forwarded, but you can still heavily influence it through the initial placement of units and by strategically using hero skills.

After the introduction part of the game, I was free to practically go anywhere I want in this big map of the material plane, and do things my way. Teleportation is common; the player isn’t deprived of fast traveling even to unexplored locations even from the start.

Personally, fresh off coming from playing Baldur's Gate 3 and Diablo IV? Dragonheir: Silent Gods definitely passed the vibe check for me, and feels somewhat similar to either of those games in its artistic tones and gameplay mechanics. The use of the 20 sided dice alone is a nice nod to Dungeons and Dragons’ style of play.
