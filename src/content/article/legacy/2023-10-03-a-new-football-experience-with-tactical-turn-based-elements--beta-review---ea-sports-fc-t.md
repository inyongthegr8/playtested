Turn-Based Tactics

## ‚ú®Beta Overview
EA Sports FC Tactical, previously known as EA Sports Tactical Football, is set to bring a refreshing turn-based twist to football games. Developed by KLab Inc in collaboration with EA, this game is currently undergoing early access testing in select regions and is gearing up for a global release. It promises to redefine the football gaming experience by introducing turn-based strategy elements into the mix.  EA is definitely set to expand its range of football mobile games; We last covered EA Sports FC Mobile here. Now, we are covering its tactical counterpart in this article.


## üìäPerformance
EA Sports FC Tactical is very clearly still in its early build stage, as they didn‚Äôt even change the name yet in-game and it's still bearing the old branding of EA Sports Tactical Football. However, despite this, the game already demonstrates solid performance, even turned up to high graphics settings in my Snapdragon 888 device. I experienced smooth gameplay with a consistent 60fps, setting a positive tone for the overall experience. The gameplay is already solid and I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs.


## üé®Graphics
Visually, the game holds its own against other football titles, perhaps similar looking to its counterpart real-time football game, EA Sports FC. However, what truly sets it apart is its dazzling cinematic approach to action and animations. The in-game sequences during matches have an over-the-top, almost anime-like quality. This unconventional presentation style is accompanied by upbeat music and a dazzling array of visual effects that add a unique charm to the game.


## üìúGame Modes
EA Sports FC Tactical features a variety of game modes, including the World Tour single-player progression, friend matches, limited-time matches, and multi-game leagues. These diverse modes contribute to the overall gameplay format, coalescence into one gameplay format, the tactical turn-based matches.


## üéÆGameplay
The gameplay is pretty compartmentalized into player match-ups. In matches, player movement across the field is automated and presented in a coaching board style. However, when players encounter each other, the game shifts into an action-packed match-up mode. Here, players must choose from various actions, such as tackling, intercepting, dribbling, passing, or shooting, depending on their strategy. The outcome is determined by the actions chosen by both players and the players' ratings, adding a layer of strategy and predictability to each encounter.

As said earlier, the presentation during these matchups is nothing short of impressive. The animations that play out based on the results of these battles are dynamic and engaging. However, it's worth noting that after playing for a while, the animations will become repetitive, and you‚Äôll probably want to skip them entirely. Fortunately, there's an option to double the game's speed or fully automate the gameplay, allowing players to focus on team strategy and power levels.

Of course, the team‚Äôs rating is determined by their players' levels and overall quality, in which the game‚Äôs live service progression comes into play. It features traditional gacha gaming mechanics for collecting players and upgrading them through the use of materials. Login bonuses, passes, and events also exist to provide players with more rewards and avenues for grinding and spending money to progress. Furthermore, the game boasts an impressive roster of over 15,000 authentic football stars hailing from the top European football leagues, such as the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and Serie A, providing players with a robust team management experience.


## ‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
EA Sports FC Tactical, with its turn-based tactical approach to football gaming, brings a fresh perspective to the genre. While the early access version already demonstrates solid gameplay and stunning presentation, its full potential remains to be seen upon the global release. With EA's commitment to building an ecosystem around the game along with its real-time counterpart, the future looks promising. The key question is whether EA Sports FC Tactical can deliver on its promise of providing a new football experience with tactical strategy-based elements.
