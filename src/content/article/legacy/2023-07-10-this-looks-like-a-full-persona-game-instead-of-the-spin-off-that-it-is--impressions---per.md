Looks like the Persona franchise is expanding at an unprecedented rate. In addition to the recently announced Persona 5 Tactica and Persona 3 Reload (a complete remake of Persona 3), we are also being treated to an official mobile spin-off titled Persona 5: The Phantom X. Interestingly, this spin-off appears to be much more than just a spin-off, resembling a fully-fledged game in its own right.

For the uninitiated, Persona 5: The Phantom X is an RPG that combines turn-based combat, slice of life elements, and an anime-inspired art style. Serving as a mobile + PC spin-off of the popular Persona 5 game and Persona series as a whole, it brings players back to Japan and reintroduces them to the Phantom Thieves, now led by a fresh protagonist and featuring a new cast of characters. Notably, this installment is specifically designed for the mobile platform, marking a first for the series.

Shown above, the new trailer shown at the TapTap Game Conference 2023 showcases more of the game, including FMV anime scenes made specifically for the game, as well as the cel-shaded art style from Persona 5 and the upbeat music and jazz rock elements of the series. It also highlights the main protagonist, codenamed "Wonder".

Of course, it wouldnâ€™t be Persona without its trademark slice-of-life elements. Including going to school, going to the gym, roaming around the city, eating out, playing video games, and doing just about anything you would expect a high-schooler would do.

Also seen in the trailer, The turn-based combat features a traditional JRPG system that seems to have been directly borrowed from Persona 5, showcasing similar UI elements, mechanics, and an overall visual presentation.

As a Persona fan, I'm very excited about this game. However, I'm a bit reserved when it comes to the "mobile-ization" of the game. The inclusion of a gacha system, while a popular mechanic in mobile games, may polarize fans of the Persona series who are more accustomed to the traditional upfront payment model. However, this has the upside of making the game free-to-play, which makes the Persona franchise accessible to a lot of people, especially since it is set to launch on both mobile and PC.
