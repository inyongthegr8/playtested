WHAT THE CAR? is a mobile game exclusive to Apple Arcade that features a quirky and humorous gameplay experience.

In WHAT THE CAR?, you control a car with two human feet, and participate in various races that evolve the car even further and in various ridiculous ways. Grow additional legs, grow springs around it to bounce around, strapped with jetpacks, ultra spaghetti legs, spider-legs, slinky cars, just about everything you could think of except being an actual car.

WHAT THE CAR? Features hundreds of unique levels and stages where you race around the tracks by jumping, flying with jetpacks, bouncing around with springs and boosts, climbing buildings, and many more absurdities that the developers have come up with. These absurd levels are fun, engaging, and satisfying to play in to. Some levels are more challenging and sometimes even frustrating than others, but it helps that the game isn’t really taking itself too seriously.

The levels are mostly in a time-attack race setup where you are actually just timed and don't race against other AI or human players so there's not much direct competition involved in the game. Each race is scored by time and gives you bronze, silver, or gold trophies depending on how quickly players finish. There are optional collectible cards on each level to give some players an additional challenge aside from the time.

And if the hundreds of unique levels isn’t enough, the game features a level editor in which player made levels are incorporated into the game and playable in the overworld in an asynchronous multiplayer setup. You can create and edit your own levels and publish them as well, giving players a true sandbox experience.
