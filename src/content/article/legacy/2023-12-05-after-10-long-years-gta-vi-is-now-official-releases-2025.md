Grand Theft Auto VI
8.6
Action
Adventure

The long-awaited moment has arrived â€” after 10 long years â€” Rockstar Games finally drops the highly anticipated first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI this December 5, 2023. After an anticlimactic leak a few months ago (It was a disappointing news for Rockstar Games, but exciting news for us), We finally have an official look at the game, and it releases in 2025.

Key Features Revealed:

Set in Vice City
First female protagonist
Dual characters; Lucia and Jason
Releases 2025

Set in Vice City

First female protagonist

Dual characters; Lucia and Jason

Releases 2025

The trailer confirms many of the leaked rumors spreading the net, and unleashes a lot of new information. These were just rumors before, so itâ€™s always nice to have official confirmation. Vice City? Check. Dual Characters? Check. The first female protagonist? Check. Humungous map? Check.

It looks amazing, honestly. The graphics look way better than any Rockstar Games title so far. The hype is very real. If the leap in gameplay and immersion is anything like in the masterpiece Red Dead Redemption 2 or the timeless GTA V which was released across a whopping three different console generations (e.g., PS3, PS4, PS5), then itâ€™s highly likely Rockstar, having taken their sweet time with GTA VI, is going to pull it off yet again.


## ðŸŽ®Platforms (Console? PC? Mobile?)

In a separate article, Rockstar Games has just confirmed that it's currently planned for the two current-gen systems, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Thereâ€™s also no indication of a PC version yet, but if history is any indication, it will probably release a year of two right after the console release. Of course, being a huge fan of GTA, Iâ€™ll probably double dip again â€” meaning Iâ€™ll buy the console version and then buy the PC version again. Nintendo will probably once again miss out on this new Rockstar AAA game, but that could soon change if the rumors about a Switch successor releasing next year turn out to be true.

Now, GTA VI is cool and all, but for mobile gamers, on the other hand, when can we expect a mobile release for GTA V? We already have the classic games like GTA Vice City and San Andreas for iOS and Android, so one can only hope they can release at least GTA IV and V as wellâ€¦ and soon. Well, you will probably need a 50GB free size storage to install GTA V.


## ðŸ“ŠPossible System Requirements

When examining the possible system requirements for GTA V's hypothetical PC release in 2024 or 2025, we could use history to make an educated guess. When GTA V and RDR 2 were released, their minimum system requirements specified mid/high-tier GPUs from five years prior and even older on CPUs, around 5 years older or more.

So, if GTA V for PC were to be released in 2026 or 2027, its minimum requirements might involve a GPU released in 2020 or 2021, such as the RTX 2070 or RTX 3060. The CPU requirement could be something like an i7-8700k or Ryzen 5 3600, aligning with the CPUs of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
