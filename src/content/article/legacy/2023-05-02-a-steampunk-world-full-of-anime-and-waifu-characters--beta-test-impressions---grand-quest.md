Pre-register

Grand Quest is a gacha game set in a steampunk world full of anime and waifu characters. The art style is impressive and while it features gacha and waifu aspects, they’re not over the top and the characters are not blown out of proportions. Grand Quest is seemingly set in a steampunk universe where there is magic and technology, but the world is clean and pristine looking than most interpretations.

The game features an intriguing story where you are a highly talented arcanist student looking for your missing teacher, meeting all sorts of characters and enemies along the way.  The story is investigative in nature and feels like a grand adventure of sorts, fitting the game's title.

The story is told in multiple chapters and missions, with the missions mostly composed of battles that players have to beat. The battles are generally played automatically, requiring no player input to control the character’s movements and attacks.

In between the combat missions are cutscenes and dialogues between the characters, some of which are present in visual novel form, some are presented in a more unique animated comic-book style approach that’d be sure to catch the players’ attention. These cutscenes can be fast forwarded and even fully skipped, so there’s absolutely no need to sit through everything if you’re not interested.

You can upgrade everything in this game as part of the progression: your characters, weapons, skills, and participate in a gacha system where you can spend in-game resources and real money to draw characters.

Since this is a closed beta test, note that not everything is finalized. Nevertheless, in the current state of the game, I was able to complete a couple of chapters and unlock various game modes with ease. There are no energy limiting systems I’ve encountered so far and this bodes well for the future of this game. So far, Grand Quest is promising and I hope they refine it even more.
