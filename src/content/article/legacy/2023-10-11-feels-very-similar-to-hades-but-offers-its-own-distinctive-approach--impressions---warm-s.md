Warm Snow is an action roguelike that manages to strike an impressive balance between familiarity and innovation. Drawing inevitable comparisons to Hades, it delivers a fast-paced gaming experience that's both addictively entertaining and uniquely its own.

Warm Snow distinguishes itself with agile, fluid, and satisfying combat. The flashy and visceral visual effects are amazing and fits perfectly with the game's action-packed tone. Players can experiment and swap found items called relics between four different slots, altering their function. Clear rooms, combat different types of enemies, and kill the boss to end the chapter. Next chapter, rinse and repeat. If you die, back from the start.

The game's depth extends further with a wide array of relics, swords, and numerous combat styles by way of the statues that are unlocked after each boss defeated. This abundance of options ensures that each playthrough feels distinct and exciting, and keeps on giving players options as they go deeper in the chapters.

The game offers an experience that is both similar to and distinct from Hades, making it a compelling choice for those who crave high-speed swordplay and enjoy experimenting with unique character builds. It's a title that can aptly serve as a precursor to the much-anticipated Hades 2, especially for Hades 1 fans.
