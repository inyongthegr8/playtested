In PAYDAY: Crime War, you are in a squad of bank robbers and you have to perform heists such as robbing banks or jewelry stores to progress throughout this fun cooperative FPS game. You can either do it silently or face the wrath of endless cop raids while trying to steal and escape.

PAYDAY: Crime War has been updated to focus entirely on PvE cooperative gameplay, similar to the original Payday games like Payday: The Heist. This means that the PvP game mode has been entirely removed, and players can only work together to complete heists and missions against AI civilians, guards, and police.

The game features a variety of missions that require players to work together to steal valuable items, rob banks, and fight off law enforcement. You first have to spend money to be able to start Heists, and upon successfully completing it, you earn money and rewards.

There is a high level of customization that players can achieve. Players can choose from a variety of weapons and equipment, and they can also customize their gear with attachments as they progress through the game. This allows players to tailor their characters to their preferred play style and adds an extra layer of depth to the game.

After completing a heist, players are rewarded with cash and experience points. These rewards can be used to purchase new weapons and equipment, unlock new skills and abilities, and upgrade existing gear.

The gameplay loop of PAYDAY: Crime War involves a mix of strategic planning, fast-paced action, and cooperative teamwork. Players must work together to overcome obstacles and complete objectives while fending off waves of enemies and collecting rewards along the way. This cycle is continued over and over again, leading to more powerful gear and more difficult heists.
