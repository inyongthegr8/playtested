Myth: Gods of Asgard takes players on an epic adventure through a familiar world based on Norse mythology. As a hack and slash action role-playing game, it offers a unique and immersive experience, intense combat system, a rich narrative, and stunning visuals. I was able to try out the Android version of the game, in which a Closed Beta Test is scheduled for June 3, 2023

Players can expect to encounter, summon, or even control familiar gods, such as Odin, Sif, and Thor, while also discovering lesser-known figures from Norse lore. Myth: Gods of Asgard also features full-on voice acting, what I liked from this game is that despite the compelling story, the cutscenes and dialogue are short and are minimal. It jumps straight to the hack and slash actions for the most part.

The gacha system in Myth: Gods of Asgard revolves around Divine Powers, allowing players to summon mighty gods from Norse mythology for assistance in combat or to receive their blessings, enhancing skill effects. Each hero possesses a unique set of skills, and it becomes crucial to strategically utilize Divine Power to improve combat power and overall gameplay experience. While Divine Powers can be obtained through the gacha system, players also have the option to gradually acquire them by farming shards.

Combat system is simply amazing. Players can perform a combination of normal and powerful attacks, execute special moves, and dodge or dash to avoid incoming enemy attacks. The combat is a finely tuned and thrilling intense experience; fluid, kinetic, flashy, and visually stunning.

For the main story campaign, it revolves around clearing dungeons one after the other, and facing various bosses with their own style of attacks and difficulties. Not only dying can result in failure, but also there is a timer for some missions. Even if you can skillfully avoid enemy and boss attacks and slowly chip their health to death, you will still fail if you take too much time. The boss fight design is the spongy type with too many health points, and by the second chapter you already need to tinker around with the items, talent tree, and divine powers to be able to survive or kill them on time.

A surprising but welcome feature for an actively controlled ARPG game, Myth: Gods of Asgard also includes auto-game mode for idle gameplay and stress-free farming. The AI powering the auto-game mode is competent (the same one used for the asymmetric multiplayer Arena mode), letting you clear missions relatively well. Still, player control is the more superior option.

As a live service game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, in-game purchases and the aforementioned gacha system. In my experience, the free-to-play experience in this game is playable enough for me, especially with the generous free gifts to the player, albeit a little challenging than outright spending money.
