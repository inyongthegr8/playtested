‚ú®Overview
IGNISTONE takes players on a journey into the heart of darkness, where they descend beneath the surface to the mines in search of the stolen Ignistone. This roguelike adventure promises a blend of strategy and skill in a simple package as you engage in one-on-one combat against thieving adversaries. While it may give off the visual vibes of classic PS2, Nintendo, or even early 2000‚Äôs flash games, IGNISTONE manages to instill a modern gameplay experience with its rogue-lite mechanics.


**Pros:**
- Only needs mouse; only 3 moves to master
- Simple but challenging gameplay
- A unique blend of persistent and temporary progression
- Extra mini-games and facility upgrade mechanics


**Cons:**
- Some minor bugs and control shortcomings


üìñStory
There‚Äôs not much to tell about the story, only that the Ignistone has been stolen by a mysterious group of manipulated members of your own people, the Mame Tribe. It‚Äôs up to you and your companion to journey deep beneath the treacherous mines in search of the IGNISTONE. Despite its simplicity, the game manages to infuse a surprising amount of Ignistone lore into its lighthearted and child-friendly premise.

üé®Graphics
The game evokes distinct vibes reminiscent of the PlayStation 2 era, classic Nintendo games, and even the charm of Adobe Flash games, and it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly which, as it seems to amalgamate elements from all three elements. The lighthearted 2D cartoon cut-out aesthetics set the stage for a deceptively simple yet deep engaging gameplay experience.

üéÆGameplay
The game begins quite simply, offering only three basic moves: Attack, Parry/Block, and a Special Attack that becomes available once the meter is filled. It‚Äôs basically Dark Souls style of combat but stripped down of everything ‚Äî including rolls and actual movement, leaving only attack and parry as the ONLY means of engagement. The game can be played entirely with just the mouse. However, don't be fooled into thinking it's overly simplistic, as there is a surprising depth to the gameplay that makes it both challenging and enjoyable.

Each encounter with adversaries becomes a strategic head-on dance, demanding precise timing and mastery of your character's moves and the timing of the varied types of enemies. Some attack quickly, some have a very predictable telegraph, and others are outright confusing and hard to predict. Choosing the right moment to attack, parry, block, or unleash a special move can be the difference between success and defeat. Parry cancels the whole damage at the risk of taking full damage if unsuccessful, while regular blocks only mitigate the damage taken, so the character is not exactly safe.

Descending deeper, every 5 levels, you get to choose from three randomized layouts of the next 5, be it filled with enemies, loot, or unknown elements, you have some degree of control of what's to come.

‚è´Progression
As a rogue-lite, IGNISTONE offers a unique blend of persistent and temporary progression. When your character meets their untimely demise in the depths, they are rescued by his companion and return to the safety of the village. Here, you retain your hard-earned currency called "berries," and the progress to the last saved checkpoint, which occurs every 10 floors.

However, there's a twist to this mechanic. Any weapons crafted during your perilous runs are forfeited, along with valuable crystals. This presents an intriguing challenge, as you must carefully consider when to retreat to the village and when to press onward. Venturing deeper into the caves yields more formidable adversaries but also brings you closer to the Ignistone.

Every 10 levels, the game provides you with the option to safely return to the village, offering a much-needed respite and allowing you to deposit your resources. However, it comes at a cost ‚Äì any consumable mushrooms you possess are lost upon your return.  Overall, these mechanics strike a delicate balance between pushing your limits and returning to safety, choosing powerful weapons over weaker ones for safety, and deciding whether to advance or conserve non-persistent elements, fearing their loss in potentially challenging runs.

Inevitably, you'll lose weapons and shields, and you may find yourself farming lower levels for berries, crystals, and shards, often relying on wooden gear to avoid losses. It's a balancing act that adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. The decision of whether to continue your descent or return to the village is a constant source of tension and excitement.

Beyond the core dungeon-crawling experience, IGNISTONE introduces other minor and major elements with the inclusion of mini-games and village upgrades. As you progress, you have the opportunity to enhance your town's facilities, including the Blacksmith, Amulet Robot, and Store.

Upgrading these facilities unlocks access to a wider array of items and provides greater flexibility in the game's crafting system. For example, unlocking the exchange of hard-earned berries for various types of crystals, crafting amulets to gain passive modifiers, and upgrading facilities to equip more amulets and craft new weapons.

üößShortcomings
While IGNISTONE offers a thoroughly enjoyable gameplay experience, it is not without its minor flaws. I have encountered a game-breaking bug where after successfully parrying and activating a special move at almost the same time, I found myself unable to perform any actions during combat, leading to an unfortunate death. I was not able to reproduce this though so it might have been a rare bug.

Another notable issue is the game's somewhat amateurish control bindings. Pressing the Escape key abruptly closes the game without warning, making it all too easy to accidentally exit your play session. Additionally, IGNISTONE currently lacks controller support, despite its potential compatibility with a controller layout. This omission might disappoint players who prefer alternative input methods.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion
IGNISTONE is a delightful and challenging roguelike adventure that successfully captures the essence of classic console and flash games and combines it with modern roguelites. Its seamless blend of simplicity and depth, coupled with the balance of persistence and temporary progression, results in an engaging and addictive experience. The incorporation of village-building elements and mini-games adds layers of variety to the gameplay, ensuring that players remain engaged for extended periods.
