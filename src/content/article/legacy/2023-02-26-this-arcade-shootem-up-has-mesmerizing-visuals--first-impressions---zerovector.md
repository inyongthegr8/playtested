ZeroVector is an arcade vertical shoot’em up designed to be played with one finger, which is used to move the player's ship. The ship automatically fires at enemies, and the player must avoid the incoming projectiles cluttering the map.

The player ship has a special move called "Reversal," which is activated by tapping with two fingers. This move temporarily sends back all projectiles to the enemies, allowing players to clear the screen and get a brief moment of respite, helpful when overwhelmed by projectiles and enemies.

As players progress through the run, they collect points and powerups spawned by eliminated enemies. These powerups upgrade the player's ship's weapons, including the spray pattern and mechanics, and give them temporary abilities like an EMP or a protective shield.

Players start with three lives, and there is no opportunity to replenish them during a run. The goal of the game is to beat the top score, with each run being endless.

ZeroVector features four different bosses, each with their own attack patterns and behavior. Players must use their skills and upgrades to defeat these bosses and progress through the game.

ZeroVector uses a minimalist approach to its graphics, with simple geometric wireframe shapes and bright neon colors. The game's player ship, enemies, and bosses are all made up of simple shapes such as squares, triangles, and circles. The animation is super fluid and the visual effects are mesmerizing especially when ships blow up and effects are all over the screen.

ZeroVector is a simple shoot’em up game that you will either like or not like within the first 10 minutes. It’s free so anyone can try it. Is it worth a try? If you love shoot ’em up games, It’s a yes for me.
