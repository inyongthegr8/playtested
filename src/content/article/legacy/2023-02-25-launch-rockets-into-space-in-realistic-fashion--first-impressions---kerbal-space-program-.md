Kerbal Space Program 2, or KSP2, is essentially a space flight simulator that offers players the opportunity to design, engineer, build, and launch their own rockets, spacecraft, and planes as they attempt to explore the vast reaches of the fictional Kerbol System and beyond.

Players control the Kerbals, an up and coming alien species living in the Kerbol Star System. They’re cute, quirky, clumsy, and funny looking green aliens that add a sense of humor and silliness to the game, providing us relief from the grim and dangerous nature of space travel.

The graphics are pleasant, with high resolution textures, advanced lighting, particle effects, and atmospheric effects like clouds. Compared to the first game, this is a welcome visual overhaul that helps create a realistic feel to match the simulator nature of the game.

Kerbal Space Program 2, like the first game, still features in some degree a highly realistic physics engine, which accurately models the forces and effects of gravity, aerodynamics, and orbital mechanics. This means that players must carefully plan and execute their missions, taking into account factors such as weight distribution, atmospheric drag, fuel consumption, and gravitational effects from celestial bodies.

This game is hard to learn, and hard to master. After all, players are learning real-life orbital mechanics and physics. However, the pay off is extremely rewarding once you’ve grasped the basics and now off to building rockets and launching into space. This gameplay loop of designing parts, testing them, and taking them to actual missions takes a lot of time and effort and are all entertaining from start to finish. The countless failures leading to a success makes for a very rewarding gameplay experience.

There’s not much content yet for the game, many of the features even from the first game are currently missing and are still in the pipeline of what’s to come. However, what Kerbal Space Program 2 does well is the initial accessibility and setting up the necessary foundation and architecture for additional content that hopefully, will eclipse the scope of the first game in a few years.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
