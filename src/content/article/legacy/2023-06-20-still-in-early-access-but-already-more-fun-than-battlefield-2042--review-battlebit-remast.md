**Cons:**

While still in its early access stage, BattleBit Remastered showcases potential for an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience. With its low-poly graphics and immersive sound design, the game aims to deliver a fast-paced and action-packed experience for up to 254 players per server.

BattleBit Remastered's low-poly graphics evoke a distinct visual style reminiscent of games like LEGO, Roblox, or Minecraft. While this style may make it challenging to spot enemies at times due to reduced visual detail, it's worth noting that much of the visual clutter that goes along the usual AAA high fidelity games are out of the way, so its an even trade-off. Furthermore, the clean and streamlined visuals help maintain high performance and optimize the game for its impressive player count, as well as ease up development costs and time.

Similar to how Battlefield's sound design made a name for itself, the immersive sound design in BattleBit Remastered deserves commendation. Realistic audio cues, explosions, and gun sounds create a heightened sense of immersion, further enhancing the chaotic battlefield atmosphere. The strategic use of sound becomes crucial for players to identify threats, communicate with teammates, and immerse themselves fully in the game's environment. Except for the low-poly visuals, everything in this game is of a high degree of detail and possesses a somewhat arcade-like realism.

BattleBit Remastered introduces players to a destructible environment, allowing for strategic destruction and environmental manipulation. The ability to shape the battlefield adds a layer of depth and tactical decision-making to gameplay. The game supports vehicular combat with a variety of tanks, helicopters, transports, and sea vehicles in some game modes, offering players diverse options for traversing the battlefield and engaging in intense battles.

The gunplay is amazing; it feels fluid to control, and the shots are accurately represented in the gameplay. The recoil now feels just right, not overpoweredly easy like in COD, but also not overly difficult to control like in CSGO. However, due to the massive player matches, long-range engagements and limited block visuals, hitting an enemy and getting a kill is much harder than usual.

In addition, it also adapts one mechanic from the more hardcore shooters in the FPS genre, which is the tactical reload or magazine cycling. When a player runs out of ammunition in their current magazine, they can perform a tactical reload, discarding the partially expended magazine and replacing it with a fresh one. However, the discarded magazine still holds any remaining rounds and will be cycled back, unless they manually move the bullets which will take time.

The class system, featuring Assault, Medic, Recon, Engineer, and Support roles, harkens back to traditional Battlefield games, providing players with distinct playstyles and encouraging teamwork. Additionally, the game offers familiar game modes like Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Rush, which provide a mix of large-scale battles and focused objectives.

BattleBit Remastered also features proximity-based voice chat that even persists a few seconds after death (entirely optional for the player) facilitating real-time communication with both friendlies and enemies. This feature promotes coordination, enhances immersion, and adds to the overall tactical experience on the battlefield, as well as fun factor with hilarious on-mic death moments with other players.

The game's progression system allows players to unlock new attachments and gadgets by increasing their kill count and rank. While this system offers a sense of achievement and rewards dedicated players, it may pose challenges for newcomers who find themselves matched against experienced players with a plethora of unlocked gear. This imbalance can lead to frustration, and it would benefit the game's overall experience if the developers address this issue in future updates.

Customization is another aspect that BattleBit Remastered excels at. With over 45 weapons and extensive customization options (and still counting), players can tailor their loadouts to their preferred playstyle. This level of customization adds depth and personalization to the gameplay experience, allowing players to adapt their weapons to different combat situations. Prefer close quarters? Equip a 1x scope. Prefer long range engagements? Install a recoil compensator and long range scope.

BattleBit Remastered, despite being in early access, demonstrates a lot of potential as a multiplayer FPS. Its unique combination of low-poly visuals, immersive sound design, and large-scale battles creates an engaging and fast-paced gameplay experience. I've encountered occasional crashes when I first initialized the game, but since then, it has worked flawlessly so far, with smooth performances during gameplay.

While there are huge areas for improvement, such as balancing the progression system for new players, more balanced maps, and a more refined matchmaking, the game showcases promising features and mechanics that could capitalize on a market currently devoid of a proper Battlefield-like game. As the development progresses, BattleBit Remastered has the opportunity to refine its gameplay, address player feedback, and solidify its position as a competitive multiplayer shooter.

Conclusion:

BattleBit Remastered offers an intense and chaotic multiplayer experience that embraces its low-poly aesthetics and combines them with immersive sound design and massive-scale battles. The Early Access release, as of right now, is not without its issues and shortcomings, but with continued updates and community involvement, it has the potential to become a notable contender in the FPS genre.
