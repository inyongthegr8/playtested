- challenging puzzles


- satisfying gameplay## Cons


-intrusive ads

-out-of-place boss fights

Hyperforma is a literal unique take on the 'Breakout' puzzle formula, bounce around the levels, punch your way through the defenses, and hack the system in this unique puzzle game.

The game's setting is filled with geometric shapes and neon colors, giving it a futuristic and otherworldly feel. The environments are minimalistic but recognizable, with each chapter featuring unique architecture and design. The game's user interface is simple and intuitive, with a clean and modern design that fits perfectly with the game's overall aesthetic.

The story is simple and involves the player character, a lone explorer looking to find the “Princess” and his journey into an ancient cyberspace of a mysteriously vanished civilization. It is mostly told through a series of short minimalistic cutscenes and bits of dialogue with various entities you encounter. While the premise is intriguing, the actual plot is not particularly deep or memorable. That being said, the story is more of a backdrop for the puzzler gameplay than a main focus.

The music is a mix of synthwave and futuristic, with a heavy emphasis on beats and energetic tones. The sound effects are also well done, with each action in the game accompanied by a satisfying sound, the game even recommends the players to wear earphones for better immersion, although I personally feel that this isn’t necessary.

The gameplay in Hyperforma revolves around solving puzzles by moving and rotating geometric shapes. You can rotate the puzzle in all axes but the last one requires the use of two fingers. The whole gameplay formula of Breakout or Brick Breaker is literally spun in on itself by instead letting the player bounce around the screen, with the ability to launch the user towards the center of the puzzle, hitting and breaking other obstacles, clearing the way towards the “core” of the puzzle.

There is a “core” in the middle that needs to be reached by the protagonist, and is protected by various shapes of different characteristics: some will break, some can be activated that results in various effects — some positive, some negative; some are hazardous to the player and can eliminate the protagonist. You can freely rotate the puzzle at all times to help the player, and it all becomes an engaging puzzle game that requires spatial awareness, timing, prediction, and reflexes.

In addition to rotating the puzzles and launching the protagonist towards the puzzle, players can also unlock skills as he levels up, and activate them to varying effects, increased breaking power, cloning the user, or shrinking anything it hits.

At the end of the chapters, there is an out-of-place boss fight that instead revolves around — quite literally — the bosses and you have to avoid its projectiles while continuously shooting it to damage. It’s kinda its own separate thing from the puzzles, feels like an unnecessary addition, and throws away every skill you’ve unlocked and practiced.

Hyperforma starts off relatively easy, but quickly ramps up the difficulty as you progress through the levels and chapters. These puzzles require a mix of logic, spatial awareness and reflexes. There were several moments where I had to stop and really think about how to proceed instead of blindingly launching myself towards the center. While the gameplay is challenging, it never feels unfair or frustrating. Each puzzle feels like a gratifying achievement when you finally reach the center.

While the game is free-to-play, it is littered with intrusive ads that play every level or two, as well as appearing on top of the screen real estate while playing. Besides that, there is also an option to watch ads to get better rewards, or just outright purchase the premium version for a cheap price of $5.

Conclusion:

Hyperforma is an engaging and visually stunning puzzle game that is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the challenging simple puzzle games that involve spatial analysis, reflexes, and music. The game is rewarding and the visuals are minimalistically stunning, just prepare to watch some ads every now and then if you’re looking to play it for free.
