Over six years later and crafted over the course of more than three years by a collaborative effort of over 50 dedicated modders, a new fan-made DLC called Pale Court breathes new life into the immersive world of Hollow Knight. With its stunning new boss fights, captivating music, expanded charms, faithful art direction, and some bonus secrets, Pale Court promises to capture the essence of the base game while offering a challenging and memorable extension of the Hollow Knight experience.

The main focus of the mod is in its five new boss fights, featuring The Five Great Knights. These formidable adversaries offer intense and thrilling encounters that rival the base game's most iconic battles. Each Great Knight possesses unique attack patterns and abilities, requiring players to adapt their strategies and master precise timing to emerge victorious.

The meticulous design and attention to detail put into these boss fights by the modders is commendable, and if you were to show them to any other Hollow Knight players without revealing that it's a mod, they would believe it to be new content made by the developers themselves.  Hollow Knight - Pale Court takes place after the events of the main game, requiring players to have completed the main story before venturing into this new content.
