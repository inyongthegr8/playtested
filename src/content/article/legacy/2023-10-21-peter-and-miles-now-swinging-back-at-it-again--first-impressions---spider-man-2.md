Spider-Man 2 is finally here and it's kicking ass. Even with the introduction sequence, it is immediately action-packed and doesn't skip a beat. I literally got goosebumps while playing through the initial set piece, which could even pass as a climax in other games. (which I'm not going to spoil, the gameplay shown above is a random snippet taken from my playthrough). Immediately, It also clearly showcases the power of the PS5's SSD with the amount of city panning and fast traversal it seamlessly executes.

The story takes place in the same continuity as the previous games, and it's centered around Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they grapple with personal challenges while facing new and formidable threats.

Graphically, Spider-Man 2 maintains the high standards set by its predecessors. The visuals strike a balance between realism and comic-book stylized character designs. New York City and its added new surrounding boroughs are finely detailed, providing an impressive backdrop for the game's open world setting. Swinging through the towering skyscrapers is an exhilarating experience, and the day-night cycle adds depth and atmosphere to the city.

The game introduces new traversal and combat abilities, including web-based gadgets and unlockable suits that enhance the Spider-Men's playstyles. Notably, the game strives for a balanced playing field between Peter and Miles, introducing new abilities for Peter to match Miles' electric powers and invisibility. Both Spider-Men boast a wide range of costumes with various color variants, which expands the roster considerably.

Overall, Spider-Man 2 appears to be building on the strengths of its predecessors, delivering an exciting and visually impressive experience, with a deeper narrative that explores the personal lives of its beloved characters. The game keeps the essence of what made the series great while introducing subtle improvements and offering various options for players to customize their experience.
