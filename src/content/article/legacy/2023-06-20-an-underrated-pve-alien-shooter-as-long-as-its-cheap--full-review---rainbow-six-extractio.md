Developed and published by Ubisoft, Rainbow Six: Extraction brings together the tactical prowess and intensity of Rainbow Six Siege with a thrilling PvE (Player vs. Environment) experience, heavily inspired by the successful limited-time game mode, Outbreak, in Rainbow Six Siege, Extraction expands upon that cooperative gameplay experience.

Rainbow Six: Extraction features graphics that are comparable to its predecessor, Rainbow Six: Siege, as both games utilize the same AnvilNext game engine. The visual fidelity in Extraction maintains the high standard set by Siege, with detailed environments, realistic but somewhat stylized character models, and impressive lighting effects heavily accentuated by the game’s dark atmosphere. All of these are achieved without sacrificing performance, as Extraction performs smoothly, perhaps just as smooth as Siege.

Extraction introduces a refreshing change to the traditional Rainbow Six formula by emphasizing tactical teamwork and coordination against a common enemy: the enigmatic alien threat known as the Archaeans. Players form a team of three operators — characters taken from Rainbow Six: Siege, each possessing unique gadgets and abilities that can complement one another. The synergy among teammates becomes crucial as you embark on more difficult missions ranging from gathering intel and hunting down elite enemies, to planting bombs and saving trapped operators in various infected zones. The level design is well-crafted, featuring intricate maps with multiple entry points, destructible environment, and environmental hazards that further challenge players.

The whole mission format is divided into multiple phases/areas, and the team can call for extraction at any point in the mission. Players can choose to complete all objectives, skip some or all of them and move on to the next area if continuing is not viable, or they can opt to completely call off the mission by extracting to save their gathered experience if the going gets tough. This adds a risk and reward element, as well as a sense of emergent storytelling to the gameplay where not everything must be completed and not everything needs to reset back from start.

The combat encounters are intense, especially when facing the diverse horde of alien threats – all while under pressure in doing the varying objectives. The ability to weaken or eliminate these threats by targeting their nests adds a layer of strategy, as you must decide when to go for the objective, when to extract, and when to thin out the enemy's numbers.

I was actually going in with low expectations for the game, considering the mixed receptions it received when it originally launched back in 2022. However, with the game's recent release on Steam and a 75% off discount across all platforms, I was surprised at how fun it is. The game has already been abandoned even at this early stage, so it's not going to receive any further content or updates. However, for the content it already has, it's still a fun game to play, especially if the price is right.

Aside from the PvE action, Extraction offers an engaging progression system that encourages players to play over and over. As they successfully complete missions, players can earn experience that unlock new operators, upgrades, and customization options. Each operator possesses unique abilities, weapons, and loadout choices — similar to their Rainbow Six: Siege counterparts but tweaked for PvE gameplay. It provides diverse playstyles and encourages experimentation.

My favorite feature so far is that Rainbow Six: Extraction introduces a compelling operator rescue and health mechanic that adds depth and urgency to the gameplay. In the game, operators can become trapped or captured by the Archaean threat if they “die” on a mission, locking the operator for use by the player unless a rescue mission is mounted.

The next time you play the same map, a rescue mission is initiated as one of the objectives, the player's team must navigate through the infected zone, battling Archaean enemies along the way. Once the operator is found, a rescue process begins. The extraction is a multi-step procedure that involves securing and escorting the operator to a designated extraction point.

Along with the rescue mechanic, the health system also ensures that players cannot play the same operators repeatedly. Taking damage during missions will gradually reduce their overall health and effectiveness, requiring a period of recovery.

While Extraction's cooperative gameplay mechanics are solid, the AI is somewhat rudimentary, which is unfortunate since this is primarily a PvE game. Still, the infected aliens are supposed to be mindless anyway, so it isn’t really game or immersion breaking. It does get repetitive after a short while, especially since the unlocks are few and far between, and you're encouraged to use different operators for every mission, which further slows the progression for each character. It is advisable to play this with friends for an added fun factor.

Conclusion:

Rainbow Six: Extraction expands the Rainbow Six universe—albeit strangely, by involving aliens in the mix—delivering a compelling and intense cooperative experience. With its engaging tactical gameplay, emergent mission system, and enjoyable PvE combat, the game offers a refreshing departure from the series' traditionally strictly grounded roots. At full price, it's not a must-play by any means; however, with the current discount of 75% off, it becomes a highly compelling choice for a group of friends looking for the next PvE shooter to pass the time.
