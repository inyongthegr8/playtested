Brotato is a brand new mobile-port of the acclaimed PC game of the same name, a survival rogue-lite game that you can play with only one hand, now currently in Open Beta.

In Brotato, you control a character from a selection of five different classes with different starting stats and bonuses. Then you get to pick your starting weapon and difficulty modifiers (if unlocked, eventually).

There is zero story to this and it‘s just pure mindless fun. There’s not even a tutorial. It's a show don’t tell situation where you really have to stumble your way into the game to try and learn it. It’s simple anyway: Enemies come in waves, you have to move your character around to avoid enemy attacks. The weapons are all auto-targetted and auto-fired based on your attack speed and range stat.

Each wave requires you to survive a specific amount of seconds before starting the next wave. In between waves, you get to buy randomized weapons and items to shape your build according to your playstyle or experimentation.

Besides that, you have an EXP bar where you gain experience points upon killing mobs and upon leveling up you get to choose a random stat increase. All random item and stat choices can be rerolled unlimited times as long as you have the currency, which is collected by killing mobs.

This happens every run and always reset after every death, making it a rogue-lite. It’s a fun mechanic for the players to constantly try out other builds and experiment to their liking, ensuring that all runs are not the same.

The game is simply addicting because of this gameplay loop of trying and trying to beat your previous record and survive into higher waves, and it doesn’t require much brain power to play the game anyway which only requires playing with only one hand to control the movement.

Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a way to make it play in portrait mode, despite seemingly supporting it judging from the patch notes I’ve found online. There is also no option to activate the manual aiming option like the PC version, despite being in the Google Play Store game description.

Killing enemies and clearing hordes of enemies in Brotato is satisfying and it's gratifying to see your current build mowing down groups of baddies. On the other hand, when things get a bit too hard, narrowly escaping hordes of powerful enemies is extremely satisfying as well. Resulting into an experience that is addicting from start to end.
