Pitstop in Purgatory is a visual novel and point-and-click adventure hybrid developed by Tymedust Games in a two-month timeframe, which is surprising considering the compelling writing.

Pitstop in Purgatory’s story is full of depth and thought-provoking ideas. You play as Astrid, a frustrated young actress who recently died. She wakes up and finds herself in the afterlife, but it’s not Heaven or Hell. It’s something close to a Purgatory, so that’s what they call it for her. At the start, she doesn’t remember her death and is in a state of confusion.

At the start, you are at a loss to what happened, even the cause of death of your character is not known. It stimulates your curiosity, naturally you’d want to know more about it and compels you to play and play.

The presentation of the game is in a visual novel style, with a beautiful art-style that is both loose and unstable-looking. The art-style fits perfectly with the theme of the game, as it feels messy and muddy, as if it was from a dream or a near-death experience.

In the purgatory, you can interact with other souls and even befriend some of them, and it can lead to finding more about them, and their life on Earth. A modest romantic option is available for two of the characters, but it’s not really the main focus. Your main goal is to find your purpose and feel at peace.

While the story tells like a visual novel, it plays like a point-and-click adventure game, with items and very surface level puzzles and riddles present that are essential in advancing the dialogue, story, and progression as a whole. The puzzles and riddles add to the overall immersion of the game. They are not too difficult, but they require some creative thinking to solve. At its core, it is primarily a visual novel.

At a glance, Pitstop in Purgatory is a captivating and unique game that explores themes of death and the afterlife through a well-written story and interesting characters, all presented in a fitting beautiful art-style.
