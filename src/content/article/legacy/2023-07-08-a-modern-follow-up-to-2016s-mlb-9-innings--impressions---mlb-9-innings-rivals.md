MLB 9 Innings Rivals is a modern follow-up to MLB 9 Innings (currently MLB 9 Innings 23), a game that was originally released way back in 2016. MLB 9 Innings Rivals features significantly improved graphics, new mechanics, and fresh ideas to enhance the addicting player collecting and fantasy baseball gameplay.

Gameplay wise, the actual baseball sports gameplay is very well done. While still somewhat resembling console's MLB The Show game mechanics and UI elements, The whole process is simplified and you’re not really directly controlling every single thing going on, and mostly focused on playing as a batter or a pitcher. You can approach matches in three ways: Quick Play, which simulates the whole match instantly but requires quick play tickets; Highlight play, which takes you into the game but simulates most of it, only bringing the player in control of being a batter/pitcher a handful of times; Lastly, you can completely play the entirety of the matches in Full Play, which takes a very long time to do, even if you skip most of the presentation scenes.

Outside of the actual sport lies the fantasy baseball aspect of the game, which involves gacha and player collecting mechanics, as well as deck-building elements. As a live-service gacha game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, season passes, materials to upgrade player decks, premium currency, and an energy system called "balls" to continue playing—nothing out of the ordinary. You can also engage in PvP mode, where you are matched with players of similar deck strength. As a free-to-play experience, I find the game highly enjoyable, especially if you have a genuine appreciation for baseball and are just looking to have some decent, high-quality baseball fun on the go.
