title: Build and defend your fortress against the nightly waves of monsters | Demo Impressions - Cataclismo
game: Impressions - Cataclismo
description: Cataclismo incorporates traditional RTS base-building elements that will feel familiar to strategy fans. Elements like constructing sawmills or quarries to gather resources from the environment, building housing to accommodate the growing population, and establishing barracks to train and recruit troops. Players will also need to manage the quality of the air by constructing filters, adding another survival element. These addictive and staple elements are seamlessly combined with frantic defense building and tower defense actions where you build walls, defense, and traps with a clever lego-style system that is equally as engaging as the town building aspect.

Cataclismo incorporates traditional RTS base-building elements that will feel familiar to strategy fans. Elements like constructing sawmills or quarries to gather resources from the environment, building housing to accommodate the growing population, and establishing barracks to train and recruit troops. Players will also need to manage the quality of the air by constructing filters, adding another survival element. These addictive and staple elements are seamlessly combined with frantic defense building and tower defense actions where you build walls, defense, and traps with a clever lego-style system that is equally as engaging as the town building aspect.

I played the demo, which consisted of the first two missions of the game. The first level, while slowly and methodically introducing the game mechanics, is a huge misstep in providing a proper first impression. Instead of diving straight into the base-building tower defense that the game heavily focuses on, it unnecessarily showcased a point-and-click style of adventure and exploration. On the other hand, the second mission serves as the true start of the actual gameplay. Players are tasked with rebuilding their fortress from its dilapidated state, gradually constructing it stone by stone, wall by wall, and structure by structure. Although the tutorials appear frequently and can be intrusive, they are informative and easily dismissed.

Every night, waves of pale creatures present a challenge, testing the capability of your defenses. Even during the day, small groups of these monsters can stumble upon our castle as well. To protect your walls, you must strategically deploy militia units, traps, and various contraptions around your castle. Even if you manage to survive each night, the Mist remains, and the monsters will inevitably return the following night. To prepare for these endless threats, is it crucial to manage your resources, optimize your defenses, research your technologies, and venture beyond your territory, slowly claiming the land one small bit at a time while stumbling upon valuable deposits.
