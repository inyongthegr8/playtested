Hitman: Blood Money — Reprisal is a 1:1 mobile port of the original Hitman: Blood Money, maintaining the gripping narrative and open-ended stealth gameplay that has been a hallmark of the Hitman series. The game follows the iconic assassin, Agent 47, as he embarks on a series of missions to eliminate high-profile targets across the globe.

With the mobile port, Reprisal successfully maintains a commendable level of visual quality. It is even on par with the “next-gen” graphics of Xbox 360 at the time , instead of the PS2 visuals. The controls are executed with surprising finesse too, offering proper intuitive touch controls that respond to the current situation and gives custom icons.

The core gameplay mechanics remain faithful to the original, emphasizing stealth, strategy, and meticulous planning. Turning this game into a shooter is not encouraged, but the developers have done a commendable job in implementing aim-assist regardless.

Players are presented with a variety of tools and approaches to eliminate targets, encouraging creativity in execution. The Hitman series has always been praised for its sandbox-style levels, and Reprisal just maintains this aspect, allowing players to explore and experiment in open-ended environments.

If you're dreaming of playing the Hitman games on mobile, this is perhaps the next best thing to experiencing the latest games in the series, as this is one of the best classic Hitman games in existence. Granted, it's almost 20 years old by now, but the game has aged gracefully regardless, and it's still perfectly playable and enjoyable today.
