The gameplay mechanics in Bibots follow a classic twin-stick shooter formula: character movement is controlled using the left stick, while aiming and shooting are executed with the right stick. A well-timed dodge mechanic proves crucial for evading enemy projectiles, and the inclusion of obtainable secondary attacks, like grenades or flying discs, adds tactical depth.

The main event, however, is the titular Bibot-summoning special ability. This powerful ally can be deployed defensively or offensively, during intense encounters against a diverse array of enemy types and formidable bosses.

The game mechanics on the other hand are actually decent for a rogue-lite: Bibots employs a rogue-lite approach that encourages experimentation and replay value. As players journey through the game's levels, they're presented with a series of three random choices for temporary upgrades in each run.

Overall, the game is indeed difficult, I already died many times even on the first level and before encountering the first boss. However, restarting is no problem as there is fun to be had in trying out different weapons and upgrade combinations. The controls are a bit funky for me that it can get frustrating, but after a while you can get used to it.
