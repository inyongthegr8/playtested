More than 10 years ago, me and my friends used to play this popular Warcraft III mod called "Fight of Characters". It's basically a Dota/MOBA like game that instead features popular characters from popular Animes such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, and more.

Well, JUMP: Assemble is exactly that game fully realized into full pledge MOBA for mobile devices, and it comes with official license from Weekly Shōnen Jump! It features characters from eighth different Weekly Shonen Jump properties: One Piece. Dragon Ball. Naruto. Bleach. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen, Undead, Unluck, Mashle: Magic and Muscles.

If you're familiar with mobile MOBA games, then this is easy to pick up and play. It feels exactly like Mobile Legends, even the announcer’s voice and lines are heavily inspired by it. The game features typical MOBA character roles like Mage, Fighter, Jungler, Support, and Tank. The three-lane layout, with top, mid, and bottom lanes, provides a classic MOBA structure.  The game is enjoyable as a MOBA title, with various character types and diverse skills. Examples include AOE attacks, movement skills, stuns, heals, and knockbacks.

This game made is currently on a limited slots beta testing, and I'm fortunate to be among those who gained access. Slots have been consistently opened for three consecutive days, so far always at around 11 AM GMT+8.
