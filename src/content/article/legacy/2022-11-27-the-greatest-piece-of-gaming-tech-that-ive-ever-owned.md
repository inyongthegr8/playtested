Ever since I was a child, I always dreamt of taking my games with me when going out, and It always came with huge compromises. It meant that I wouldn’t be taking my console or PC games with me, and I’m stuck with a portable handheld with its own different and toned down games (Gameboy, Playstation Portable, Nintendo DS, Switch, etc)

Not anymore. Last year, the Valve Steam Deck was announced. While it released early this year with extreme scarcity, recently it became relatively abundant that I was finally able to purchase and receive it around two months ago. Here are my thoughts.

The Steam Deck is a handheld PC / Console hybrid that is clearly one of a kind. It is everything I dreamt of and more. It meant that I can now take my existing PC library that I have built throughout the years, install it on the device, and play it just like at home. It has a console-like interface, simple to use and easy to get into playing, while hidden under it is a much more traditional PC setup, which you can access via Desktop mode.

It is currently available for preorder for US, Europe, and Canada. And is also available reservation via Komodo in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. With more countries to come soon.

USD SRP is at $399 USD 64GB  |  $529 USD 256GB | $649 USD 512GB.

It is powered by the Steam Platform, the same client that most PC users have been using to download and play PC games over the years. So no need to rebuy games for your PC and your handheld, there is instantly cross compatibility between the two. Seamlessly transfer progress via cloud saves, play with PC users, and the ability to customize it as you see fit thanks to modding.

Cut to the chase, here’s an easy to digest breakdown of some of the things the Steam Deck can do:


## + Comes in 64, 256, 512GB options, with the ability to expand storage via SD Card or easy replacement in the internal SSD to 1TB or even 2TB


## + Same library collection as your PC, it uses Steam platform and can also play games from other platforms like Epic, Battlenet, and Origin/Uplay.


## + Play almost any PC game, indie or even AAA titles. From Hades or Stardew Valley, to Spider-Man Remastered or Cyberpunk 2077, it is playable.


## + Play handheld or connect to a Display / TV via any generic USB-C to HDMI dock or the official Steam Deck Dock.


## + Support for almost any PC accessory: Xbox, Playstation, Switch controllers, bluetooth or wired earphones, gaming keyboards and mice, etc.


## + Use game streaming services like Xbox Gamepass, Playstation Now, NVIDIA Geforce, or its built-in local streaming solution Steam Remote Play.


## + Use it as a desktop PC, install office apps or even just browse the web.


## + Install Windows 10 or 11 on it to make it a more traditional PC if you like.

For non-gamers, console users, newcomers, worry not; As the interface is easy to navigate. You just browse the Steam Store to find games to purchase / download and just click play. The Steam Deck just like any game console you ever used. No tinkering required nor complex tutorials to follow. Although learning how to tinker comes with great benefits.

Since I am already a PC power user, I found the desktop mode fun to use, in fact for me it is a game in itself that I spent hours tinkering about. Customizing my library, my games, my setup, even just plain testing random games to see if they will work well. I have probably spent most of my first weeks with the Steam Deck tinkering than actually gaming.

Performance

Most games run absolutely fine on the Steam Deck. You can play slightly older games at a locked-in 60fps at its native 800p resolution, while recent AAA titles can also run with a bit of tweaking and a lower fps setting (40 fps is highly recommended).

The only downside is that because it is running on Linux (SteamOS) , there are selected games that wouldn’t work properly for now, mostly in the realm of multiplayer games because of OS level anti-cheat support. The good news is it is currently being worked on by Valve and willing developers and the list is growing by the day. Since it's still a PC though, there’s nothing stopping you from just installing Windows OS on it, and just playing on it like a normal gaming PC.

Battery life is a bit of a mixed bag, especially for those who doesn’t know how to tweak settings and just run / play the games. But for me, it is a great compromise between weight, heat, and price. You can run most games at an average for 1 hr 30 mins to 3 hours, depending on your games and your setting. I found that tweaking settings for every game can easily give you more than two hours of playtime. I can even reach 4-5 hours for older indie titles. Poor battery life or not, this is something a simple powerbank or a nearby outlet can't solve.

The Ergonomics are designed exceptionally well. I have a very undersized set of hands and I was worried at first about compatibility, but they are still comfortable for me to play. You might see the Steam Deck as a little too big for a handheld and worry about the weight, but when you finally hold it, it feels lighter than expected.

The analog sticks and face buttons are almost full sized, just a tad smaller than Xbox / Playstation. There is also the two trackpads as additional input (usually configured as mouse cursor or anything you want really, thanks to Steam’s in-depth controller configuration capabilities), plus four back buttons, Gyro controls, and a touchscreen display.

Because of the points mentioned above, The Steam Deck easily has the most versatile controller to ever exist right now. Even beating the likes of Xbox Elite Series 2, and the Dualsense, as far as utility goes.

Upgradability and repairability are also executed perfectly in this device. While the models are just 64, 256, and 512GB versions, you can easily upgrade the internal SSD to even 1TB or 2TB, just opening the backplate and popping in a supported SSD like how you do in most laptops.

Repairability is also emphasized and empowered to users, with Valve partnering with iFixit to be able to offer customers the ability to purchase replacement parts for just about anything.

To sum it up, The Steam Deck is easily the greatest piece of gaming tech that I've ever owned. This is coming from someone who has owned various gaming PCs over the years, gaming consoles, handhelds, and even niche products like Flight Simulator sticks and VR headsets.  If it ever becomes available to your region (or if you can find a way to purchase it from abroad), it is a highly recommended device to purchase.
