Cyber Manhunt is a PC hacking-themed game that has recently made its way onto the Android platform, offering players an immersive experience as they step into the shoes of a skilled hacker, recently hired by a corporation. I was able to test a trial version of the game, and play the prologue plus the first mission.

With its focus on an accurate but toned down depiction of hacking, social engineering, and a complex storyline, this game aims to immerse players who enjoy delving into the depths of cyber espionage, as well as educate them in the dangers of the cyber world. The game is clearly inspired by similar games such as Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You, having the same gameplay elements which revolves around using an operating system to investigate people — the only difference is access is not automatically granted to you, and you have to utilize hacking in order to gain access to more information.

The main gameplay is set in the OS of the computer itself: opening applications, and browsing around the simulated internet of the game. At its core, Cyber Manhunt provides players with a range of hacking-related activities to undertake. Starting with web searches and browsing to collect basic information about targets, players can then utilize a comprehensive database to gain deeper insights about persons of interest.

A cracking software to discover and exploit passwords to access various accounts across different platforms. Hijacking social network and email accounts, requiring players to engage in email threads, conversations, and even phone calls with targets while maintaining a disguise and utilizing gathered information to build trust.

The game also introduces picture analysis of data extracted from the web, such as from news articles and social media sites, allowing players to extract valuable information and uncover relevant clues. Additionally, the phishing mechanic lets players employ clever tactics by sending phishing links to hack the targets' hardware devices, as well as social engineering them to activate said phishing links, further expanding the range of hacking methods available.

The whole setup is really streamlined, offering a casual yet still challenging and somewhat accurate depiction. The process of discovering information, such as usernames, emails, and passwords, and using them on apps is simply done through a drag-and-drop operation. There is no need for typing or excessive guesswork involved. However, for individuals well-versed in hacking, a certain suspension of disbelief is still necessary.

Cyber Manhunt excels in providing an immersive experience for players. By assuming the role of a hacker, players become part of a larger narrative, accepting tasks from the company to investigate high profile cases. The game's high level of immersion is enhanced through realistic portrayals of hacking activities and the incorporation of social engineering elements.

The look and design of most of the software, websites, and articles in Cyber Manhunt are meticulously crafted to closely resemble their real-life counterparts, effectively immersing the player in an authentic cyber world. This attention to detail not only adds to the visual appeal of the game but also enhances the overall immersion, believability, and ease of use of the hacking experience. Still, I feel that the game doesn’t have enough filler content or red herring to provide an even more immersive experience, a common gripe I have with these types of games.

As a mystery game, Cyber Manhunt is essentially a puzzle adventure game in software disguise. The narrative compels you to investigate, and the process is highly engaging. However, similar to traditional puzzle adventure games, it is possible to exploit this gameplay setup by randomly tapping articles and pages until something relevant comes up. Nevertheless, this approach is not always the solution. You still need to carefully consider your next step and determine which piece of information to provide to specific software or website. The game does not spell out everything for the player.

At the end of cases, you can infer findings based on the evidence you acquire, and you are given choices on what to deduce. However, the significance of these choices is somewhat undermined because if you select the wrong option, it results in no immediate consequence until you eventually choose the correct one. The game only gives you an illusion of choice.

Cyber Manhunt’s translation from PC to mobile touch controls are serviceable, but there are occasions where I had minor control difficulties in navigating the UI clearly designed for mouse with its small font, text boxes, and buttons.

English localization wise, they did a pretty good job at the start — which is what I’ve experienced, but I’ve read reports on the PC version that the translation gets worse as you go deeper into the game. This is bad, especially since the game is heavy on reading. However, there is surprisingly decent voice-acting for character dialogues, as well as voice-overs for phone conversations.

Conclusion:

Cyber Manhunt delivers an immersive and casual hacking and mystery experience, allowing players to explore the depths of cyber espionage and social engineering.  Although there are flaws such as the poor translation and the illusion of choice to the players, Its engaging plot combined with hacking mechanics, including web searches, database exploration, cracking passwords, and engaging in conversations, the game provides a range of online activities to channel the players' curiosity.
