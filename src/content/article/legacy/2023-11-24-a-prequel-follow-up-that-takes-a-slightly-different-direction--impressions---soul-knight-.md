Soul Knight Prequel marks a departure from the rogue-lite roots of its predecessor, introducing players to an adjacent genre: ARPGs. Boasting its own narrative set before the events of the original Soul Knight, unique characters, and a blend of pixel art and 3D graphics, Soul Knight Prequel aims to captivate both fans of the original and newcomers alike.

The gameplay of Soul Knight Prequel is characterized by its ARPG nature. As players and created characters delve into dungeons in an ARPG style reminiscent of Diablo, the emphasis is on real-time action, colorful visuals, and strategic combat. The game retains the essence of its predecessor, offering an extensive loop of dungeon crawling, loot acquisition, and character improvement. There’s two gameplay modes to start the game; The self-explanatory Story mode, and Adventure which cuts all the narrative and jumps straight into the ARPG goodness --- which is my preferred option to play. In games like this, the story is just a small part of the experience, the whole fun of it is in the farming, looting, and gearing up your characters.

The home village that you’ll encounter early on in the story will serve as a hub for various activities and interactions with NPCs; Merchants, traders, and smiths provide avenues for resource management and gear improvement, as well as the option to see and switch to your other characters, as well as see other players too. You also get your own space that you can customize the interior with furnitures and preferred colorways.

The combat system in Soul Knight Prequel retains the intensity and excitement of the original, with fast-paced battles and an array of powerful and visually spectacular skills. Players can select from seven different initial characters with secondary and hybrid classes as it levels up, each possessing unique skills trees to experiment on.

The multiplayer aspect enhances the experience, with both local LAN co-op and plans for remote online co-op, promising engaging battles and collaborative gameplay. Although even in single player, the game still requires you to connect to their servers, making the game is effectively online-only. Unfortunately, this alone is a dealbreaker for some people. Nevertheless, the game alone is a decent pixel ARPG game that's probably worth an install on your mobile phone if you love these kinds of games, especially since it's free-to-play.
