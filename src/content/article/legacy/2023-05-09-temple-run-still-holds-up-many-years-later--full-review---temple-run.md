Gameplay

Temple Run is an addictive and engaging reaction-based high score game that was first released in 2011 by Imangi Studios. The game has become a classic in the mobile gaming world, with millions of downloads, a large following of dedicated players, and has spawned multiple sequels and homages.


**Pros:**


+Simple but challenging gameplay

+Rogue-lite elements (persistent upgrades) to keep you sucked in

+Ageless visual design


**Cons:**


+Requires great reflexes to play

In Temple Run, players take on the role of an adventurer who has stumbled upon an ancient temple filled with traps and obstacles. The adventurer must endlessly run through the temple, avoiding obstacles, collecting coins, and trying to outrun a group of demonic monkeys chasing after them.

Temple Run+ is the Apple Arcade version of the game, which was released for the subscription-based gaming service offered by Apple just recently.

The game is easy to pick up and play, with simple four directional swipes and tilt (gyro) phone controls that allow the player to move left, right, jump, and slide. The game's objective is to run as far as possible, collecting coins along the way to purchase power-ups and upgrades that can help the player go further.

The player can either swipe left or right at the right time to follow the track’s direction and avoid failing, while they also need to swipe up and down at the right time to avoid obstacles such as jumping around pits, sliding down small gaps. Needless to say, this game requires great reflexes to be able to enjoy this game to the fullest.

The game's difficulty increases as the player progresses, with new obstacles and challenges introduced at each stage. The game's pacing is excellent, keeping players engaged and constantly on the edge of their seats, while giving them a satisfying feeling collecting coins and garnering points aiming for a new high score. When you die and exhaust all possible revive options, you must reset back from the start and start from zero, except for the powerups and boosts that you’ve unlocked.

Temple Run+'s graphics are noticeably old school as far as mobile graphics go, but it still holds up well as a modern game, especially since the main focus is the endless run gameplay. The game's design is inspired by the architecture and aesthetics of ancient temples, such as seen in films like Indiana Jones or games like Tomb Raider, with intricate details that give the game an authentic “temple adventures” feel.

The animations are still smooth and fluid for a 10+ years old game, adding to the fast-paced feel. The game also features some minor visual effects with some unlockable power-ups using points gathered in runs, such as the blur effect when the adventurer runs at top speed or the slow-motion effect when the adventurer is caught by the monkeys.

It also plays like a rogue-lite of sorts, with each playthrough offering a new challenge and experience, especially if you spend gold to unlock new power ups and boosts like coins multiplier or a free revive. Players can try to beat their high score, beat their friends’ or even the global high score, or unlock new achievements and complete weekly challenges, giving plenty of reasons to get sucked back into the game despite the pretty endless monotonous gameplay.

Conclusion

Temple Run+ is a classic mobile game that even if you’ve already played it years ago, it’s still worth revisiting. The game's monotonous yet challenging gameplay, ageless design, and simple controls make for an engaging and addictive experience that is hard to put down. Whether you're a fan of mindless “beat the high score” reaction-based games or just looking for a fun and entertaining game to play on your mobile device, Temple Run is definitely worth checking out.
