Everdream Valley is a delightful and lighthearted farming adventure game that combines the joys of tending to a homestead with farming, animals, and magic. Following in the footsteps of farming games like Dinkum and Stardew Valley; Everdream Valley promises to be another solid addition to the farming sim genre.

In Everdream Valley, you find yourself on your grandparents' neglected farm, ready to breathe new life into it. The game presents you with the opportunity to clean up the farm, help your grandparents, bring back the animals, and embark on quests that serve as both the story and introduction to the game’s mechanics. Although you can entirely do things at your own pace.

There is a lot to do in this game. Starting with the variety of animals: The game offers a decent variety of animals; cows, chickens, deers, sheep, fish, and dogs to engage with. There are different tiers of animal breeds to provide a sense of progression and variety, allowing players to choose their preferred level of complexity in animal management. Everdream Valley also lets you have a pet dog from a variety of choices, the game lets you train it, play with it, or pet it.

As for the farming, Everdream Valley offers the traditional variety of fruits and vegetables for you to cultivate, allowing you to create a bountiful and diverse harvest on your farm. From raspberries to apples and everything in between, the game provides a wide range of crops to cultivate and protect. I also love how the game allows you to easily move and customize trees and crops, giving you the freedom to design and rearrange your farm to your liking. However, harvesting isn’t as pleasing and satisfying as I thought it would be, to the point of being annoying and feeling like a chore to do, instead of having that rhythmic and meditative quality to it like other farming sims.

Exploring Everdream Valley's world is rewarded with the discovery of valuable items and resources needed for future building projects even for free. This incentivizes players to venture beyond their immediate surroundings and uncover hidden treasures and maybe even quests.
