I never was a big Super Mario fan, but I did play a lot of it during my NES and SNES childhood days. It's one of the earliest gaming experiences I've ever had, especially with Super Mario Bros. 1 and 3. I also a played some Mario Kart on the Switch and their recent 3D platformers, but Wonder is just really special. Classic 2D platformer Mario is back, and it's probably the best Super Mario game to date.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is not just a game; it's an experience that redefines what we can expect from a 2D platformer. It seamlessly blends the classic Mario gameplay with a heavy dose of whimsy and unpredictability.

The level design is simply wonderful and lives up to its name, the introduction of Wonder Seeds that you need to gather throughout the six worlds to defeat Castle bowser carries the whole game with its relentless whimsical surprises that keeps players engaged throughout their adventure.

The co-op experience is also a blast. You can play up to four players locally and online, and you and your friends can basically conquer the whole game that way. It's easier, more fun, and chaotic, which is perfect for the game's chaotic tone.

For those who have been following Mario's journey since the 1980s, Wonder is a joyful reminder of the series' enduring magic. For newcomers, it's an excellent entry point that embraces the spirit of the franchise while offering something refreshingly new. Nintendo has successfully combined the traditional and the innovative, making Wonder a must-play title for fans of all ages.
