Baldur's Gate 3, an epic RPG developed by Larian Studios and building on the legacy of the iconic Baldur's Gate series, was released in early access in 2020 and was met with an overwhelmingly positive response, reinvigorating interest in D&D-based video games. Larian Studios embraced the complexities of D&D's 5th Edition, creating a game that felt akin to playing the tabletop version virtually, for better and for worse. The vast world, intricate systems, and captivating storytelling that come with the experience of D&D are promised, resonating with long-time fans and newcomers alike.

- mechanics can be overwhelming for newcomers


Dungeons & Dragons is a seminal tabletop role-playing game that has captured the imaginations of countless players for over four decades. Its influence on video games has been significant and generation defining, but it has experienced highs and lows throughout its history in the digital realm.

The 1990s saw a golden era for D&D-based video games. Titles like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment not only brought the rich lore and intricate gameplay of D&D to the digital world but also introduced a new generation to the captivating fantasy universe. As gaming technology advanced however, the industry witnessed a shift towards visually stunning and action-packed games. The popularity of D&D-based video games began to wane in the late 2000s as players gravitated towards more graphically intense and fast-paced titles like Diablo, Skyrim, and The Witcher; Although, the influences of D&D can still be felt in basically any RPG video game since.

Now, three years later after Early Access, Baldur’s Gate 3 is officially out on PC, with its release on Playstation scheduled for next month and on Xbox next year. With its official launch, it treats players to an awe-inspiring adventure with a staggering amount of content, freedom, and immersion.

The world of Baldur's Gate 3 is a grand marvel, meticulously crafted with intricate detail and artistic brilliance, which of course is set in the Forgotten Realms. The art style beautifully blends the familiar D&D aesthetics with a touch of realism and is represented by AAA-level graphics, creating a captivating and enchanting experience for players. The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing as well, featuring a beautiful and memorable high fantasy orchestra that strikes players in the right moments, resulting in a masterpiece of an overall experience in the art department.

The narrative of Baldur's Gate 3 is a gripping tale of eldritch horrors and dangerous quests, woven with deep lore and emotional depth. The game's grand opening sets the stage for an epic adventure. The plot unfolds organically, guided by players' choices, which often lead to profound consequences. Baldur's Gate 3 features a cast of fully voiced characters, each with a unique personality, background, and motivations, immersing players in a world teeming with life and personality.

Newcomers to the series can jump into Baldur's Gate 3 without any prior knowledge of the previous games and still enjoy the experience.
The game provides enough context and information to understand the setting, characters, and events within the game world. While it shares the same universe and is set in the iconic Forgotten Realms, the storyline and events in Baldur's Gate 3 are independent and do not directly continue the narrative from the previous games.

The core cast of characters are all available to be selected as a main character, but players can also opt to create their own custom one with its own defined race, class, sub-class, and traits. The core characters that were not selected will become NPCs and companions in the game’s story, with their own stories unfolding along with the player, as well as the chance to die, depending on the choices of the player. The story is open-ended, not as open-ended as a true D&D game, but nonetheless a pretty authentic crafted experience for players that the developers are boasting to have over 17,000 possible endings and 174 hours of cutscenes.

The companions in the game are particularly well-developed, eliciting genuine connections with the players. Each companion brings a distinct flavor to the party, sparking lively interactions and creating memorable moments throughout the journey, as well as having their own plot and questlines. The exceptional voice acting breathes life into these characters, enhancing the emotional impact of their stories. Not to mention, the whole campaign is narrated as well by an exceptional voice actor that does the role justice.

Baldur's Gate 3's gameplay is a masterful blend of classic RPG mechanics and innovative design. The game faithfully follows the D&D 5th Edition rules, featuring a plethora of numbers and systems that enrich the experience. Character creation is extensive, offering numerous options for races, classes, backgrounds, and customization, enabling players to shape their avatars to match their playstyle and vision. The D&D 5th Edition ruleset governs the character statistics, skills, spellcasting, and combat mechanics, which will feel right at home to players familiar with the tabletop game.

The turn-based combat system is strategic and tactical, encouraging players to think critically and plan their moves wisely. Environmental interactions, elemental spells, dice rolls, and dynamic physics add depth to battles, allowing players to use their creativity to overcome challenges. While the game slowly introduces the player in its mechanics, the can be a bit too much for newcomers, as there is too much going on with the mechanics; there’s so many spells and skills to choose from and use. There’s so much going on with the different conditions, reactions, and modifiers involved in both the combat and skill-checked dialogue encounters.

Baldur's Gate 3 boasts an astonishing amount of quests and side content, and players will never be short of engaging activities. Quests are designed to flow organically into one another and feature multiple solutions and branching paths, encouraging players to experiment and approach challenges in creative ways. Characters can die or not die, friends can become foe or neutral, and rewards will vary from one decision to another.

Dialogues are an integral part of the game, and players can engage in conversations with NPCs using branching dialogue options. Role-playing is encouraged, allowing players to shape their character's personality and moral alignment, as well as utilize their skills and traits to influence the outcome of dice rolls. Saving is allowed at almost any point in the game, enabling players to test this system to its limits. However, I wouldn’t recommend this so-called "save scumming" and suggest embracing the consequences of your choices instead.

Throughout the game, players could collect loot from defeated enemies and discover valuable items in the world, and trade it with vendors around the world. Crafting and alchemy is a feature, allowing players to create new items and equipment from collected resources. Each character will have their own equipment that players can customize to their benefit and enhance their capabilities.

The open-world design also rewards exploration, as hidden treasures, secret areas, and memorable encounters await those who dare to venture off the beaten path. As far as the environment goes, players could use their characters' skills and spells to manipulate the environment, find hidden passages, or create tactical advantages in combat. Characters can also use minor but useful commands such as jump, shove, dip, and telekinesis; to navigate and utilize the environment.

Baldur's Gate 3 also supports both keyboard/mouse and controller inputs, each with significantly different UI elements depending on the input method used. The keyboard/mouse setup relies on the traditional point-and-click approach, presenting players with an overwhelming selection of choices and information in the skill bar. On the other hand, the controller scheme focuses on radial menus and organic player control using the left stick.

Both input methods are equally viable, but I felt that the controller support is better suited for newcomers to the genre, as it doesn't overwhelm players with a plethora of visual elements right from the beginning. However, once you become familiar with the complexities and intricacies of the game, you'll find the keyboard/mouse layout much more superior and faster to use, albeit at the expense of comfort.

Baldur's Gate 3’s multiplayer component is primarily designed as a cooperative experience, allowing players to team up with friends for an unforgettable co-op adventure. Players can invite friends to their session and have them control any of their companions. For those groups of players looking to take co-op to another level by regularly playing and finishing the campaign together, they can also start a campaign and each of them create their own custom character. However, the progression is still tied to the game’s host player. Gameplay wise, characters are not obligated to stay near each other or take the same actions, allowing for individual exploration. In dialogue interactions, if one character initiates a conversation, others can suggest choices, with the host ultimately deciding.

Performance wise, it ran satisfactory relative to my hardware. (i7-8700k, 32GB, RTX 3080) Never really experiencing slowdowns or stutters during my playthrough. It is also Verified for the Steam Deck, and in my testing reaches an FPS range of 30fps at its lowest, while reaching as far as 60fps. It really is a well-rounded polished experience overall. My only gripe is the abhorrent out-of-place game launcher to start the game, which can fortunately be turned off in Steam’s game launch options.

Conclusion:

Baldur's Gate 3 is a monumental achievement in the realm of RPG gaming, solidifying its place among the genre's masterpieces and delivering an experience that bridges the gap between real-life D&D and video games. The complexity of its systems, alongside its vast world and intricate storytelling, creates a rare and fulfilling gaming experience that leaves players yearning for more. It is truly the quintessential cRPG and Dungeons & Dragons game, and a benchmark for those who aspire to follow in its footsteps.

While some players might find the complexities of the game overwhelming, those who embrace them are rewarded with a rich and unforgettable adventure through the Forgotten Realms. The impressive translation of D&D mechanics, exceptional character development, immersive world design, and remarkable quest variety make Baldur's Gate 3 a must-buy for any player who loves RPG games. Even those who normally wouldn’t like turn-based RPG games, I’d still recommend it to them. Dungeons & Dragons in video games has come full circle, from its humble beginnings in text-based RPGs to its resurgence with Baldur's Gate 3.
