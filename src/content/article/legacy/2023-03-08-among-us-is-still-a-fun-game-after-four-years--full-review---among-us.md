Among Us is a multiplayer deduction party game set on a spaceship where players take on the role of either a Crewmate or a killer Impostor.


**Pros:**


+Thrilling deduction experience

+Simple and accessible, even non-gamers can play

+Highly customizable parameters


**Cons:**


-No cons

Among Us is an incredibly fun and addicting multiplayer game that challenges your deduction and deception skills. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete various tasks around the ship, kick out any Impostors; while the Impostors must sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being caught, before all the tasks are complete.

Throughout the years, I’ve played my fair share of deduction games like Town of Salem and Gmod’s Trouble in Terrorist Town, but when I first played Among Us last 2018, it was still one of the best multiplayer gaming experiences I’ve ever had with friends. And what was even better is that there is a mobile version, with crossplay, so almost everyone can jump in and build out a group to play with, as long as you have a phone. It has something to do with how simple and accessible this game is, yet the experience is so thrilling and addictive.

Gameplay Analysis

What makes Among Us so exciting is the constant tension between the Crewmates and Impostors. As a Crewmate, you have to keep a close eye on your fellow players and try to figure out who the Impostors are before it's too late. Meanwhile, as an Impostor, you have to use your wits and deception skills to blend in with the Crewmates and carry out your nefarious plans.

While in the ship, Crewmates must also perform tasks throughout the ship in the form of fun and cute mini-games, which if fully completed by everyone, grants an automatic win. Adding a time limiting element to matches that encourages both Crewmates and Impostors to act quickly and decisively. Even if the Crewmates are dead, they still have to perform tasks in order to help the still alive Crewmates.

One of the best things about Among Us is how easy it is to pick up and play. The game has simple controls and a straightforward gameplay loop, which makes it accessible to players of all skill levels, even non-gamers. However, there is still plenty of depth and strategy to be found in the game, as players learn to read each other's body language, poker faces, truth and lies; and use subtle cues to uncover the Impostors.

Highly customizable parameters

The matches in Among Us are also highly customizable to the players preference, almost everything is adjustable, kill cooldowns, distances, character visions, various timers, the number of tasks, and many more. Giving a powerful tool for a group of players to achieve the right amount of their preferred balance to the game. No need to wait for the developers to buff or nerf mechanics, nor to install mods.

The graphics and sound design in Among Us are also top-notch. The cartoonish visuals and quirky animations give the game a unique and charming style,  while the sound effects and music create a tense and immersive atmosphere so impressive that they both still have a massive cultural impact up to this day and have become easily recognizable for almost everyone.

Labor of Love

Now, in 2023 Among Us is still alive and kicking, with continuous updates that still follow the same formula, only being welcome improvements. A major update in 2021, added optional specialized roles like Engineers that can travel vents, adding to the confusion; Scientists that can keep current vitals of all players, and Guardian Angels that can protect players from getting killed.

A few weeks ago, last December 2022, an alternative Hide n Seek game mode was added. There is only one impostor, its identity revealed, and there are no meetings or ejections. Removing all deduction elements and making this game mode a full-on hunter and hunted asymmetric survival game.

Among Us also occasionally does collaborations with other franchises that adds new cosmetics to use such as the Spartan Armor from Halo, or character skins from League of Legends. More recently, they have a new collaboration with Destiny 2, adding new cosmetics such as the Hunter, Warlock, and Titan skins.

Conclusion:

Among Us is a fantastic game that is both fun and challenging. Whether you're playing with friends or strangers, the game is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat as you try to outwit and outmaneuver your opponents. So if you're looking for a game that will provide a fun, thrilling, and intense experience between friends or even strangers, playing Among Us is a no brainer.
