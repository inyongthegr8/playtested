SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a 3D platformer game that is based on the Nickelodeon animated series SpongeBob SquarePants. It is the spiritual successor to 2020’s Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated, which is in itself a remake of the original 2003 Battle for Bikini Bottom.




## Pros



## +Beautiful and Amazing level design


## +Fun and engaging platforming aspects


## +Feels like a special episode from the animated series


## +The original voice actors, many of the soundtrack and soundbits are back




## Cons


-Felt like a downgrade from Battle for Bikini Bottom

-Fetch quests can get repetitive

-No multiplayer game modes

Welcome back to Bikini Bottom, or 8 different versions of it.

In SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, You control the titular character SpongeBob, in his quest to restore his town of Bikini Bottom to normality, after a magic wishing mishap that caused his universe to collide with other alternate universes.

These universes are called wishworlds and contain an alternative version of Bikini Bottom, with many alternate versions of its inhabitants, like a Wild West Sheriff Sandy, or a movie director Squidward. Universes that SpongeBob must travel to and visit.

The premise is understandably a bit too high stakes than the usual stories in the animated series, and just timely considering the current craze about multiversal stories. It's a decent mover for both the story and the gameplay, although the premise gets old after a while, once you’ve visited multiple worlds already, even if they’re varied enough.

A remnant of the glory platforming days of the PS1 and PS2 eras

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake’s gameplay is a typical 3D platformer, which is extremely similar to games like Crash Bandicoot or Spyro the Dragon. Jumping across platforms, avoiding obstacles, using movement maneuvers like double jump, gliding, or dashes to navigate, and occasionally smashing boxes to get Jelly: the main collectible/currency, similar to coins or fruits in other games.

In between the core platforming, there are some mini games to enliven up the gameplay, like seahorse riding segments, similar to Crash Bandicoot 3’s level 'Orient Express’ where you ride an animal and must avoid and/or smash obstacles, and collect Jellies on the way.

Fetch Quests… Why??

How the story connects to the gameplay relies heavily on utilizing fetch quests after fetch quests, sometimes even piling on top of each other. And It can get pretty annoying after a while. For example, you need to find information and need help from a character, then that character will need an item in exchange. You go and find the item and another character is blocking it, requiring you to do another fetch quest. Lo and behold, to complete this fetch quest, it will require you to complete another side mission for a whole other character.

The level design is amazing nonetheless, the world is beautifully rendered and the platforming aspects are fun and engaging. It’s mostly linear but with some minor nooks and crannies that you can take to find more Jellies and smashable boxes which are simply addicting to do. There are some inconsistencies though with the smashable stacks of boxes; most will fall after smashing the bottom, but some will not and float in the air, which is annoying.

There are semblances of puzzle solving mechanics but the game never fully commits to it, resulting in a relatively easy level progression. Which honestly, isn’t a bad thing as the flow is continuous and the energetic momentum is easily maintained throughout levels. To top off the end of each level, There are easy and fun boss fights.

Missed Opportunities

Compared to the previous game, you can only control SpongeBob now, but there are more moves to unlock and use throughout the game. It is now strictly singleplayer, without any side modes with co-op capabilities. An unfortunate decision, as I think a co-op campaign is one of the many improvements the developers could have added. Imagine the LEGO games, or the PS2 classic Shrek 2.

SpongeBob can fight!

The controls are highly responsive for the most part, and I never really had any difficulties in controlling SpongeBob. My only gripe is some bindings are a bit off for me, especially with how the Dodge/Dash is bound on the same button as the Jump-Slam attack. It messes with years of muscle memory of using a Jump-Dash combo, which can lead you to death many times because you instinctively tried to dash forward while in the air, only instead you dive down to your death.

Death is forgiving as well, the game gives you multiple lives to use before completely restarting from a checkpoint. Lives are spent if you fall down while platforming, or get damaged by enemies in combat. You can also find health pickups scattered around the map to replenish your lives.

The combat on the other hand is simplistic, you just mostly use a basic spinning main attack like Crash Bandicoot to one shot most enemies, but is modernized and made more engaging by just this one simple addition, a dodge mechanic. You also have other movement abilities that can be used for combat, like Jump-Slams or Bubble Blows. Sometimes when you enter combat, the game cages you along with the enemies in a sort of arena-style battle instance, requiring you to defeat the enemies before proceeding.

From 2D to 3D

Graphics wise, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is pristine looking and the lighting is amazing. It could easily pass as a Live Action or CGI quality animation and while it doesn’t look exactly like the 2D animated series, they’ve done the transition from 2D to 3D justice. The game also features many returning soundtrack and sound bits from the animated series, including the original voice actors. As a bonus, all the different worlds also have their own distinct themed soundtracks.

When I am playing SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, the feeling is still there, like I am watching the good ol’ cartoons. The voice actors are the same, the sound bits are the same, the jokes are still on point, and the overall atmosphere is still SpongeBob SquarePants. It genuinely felt like I was watching one of the episodes. It doesn’t hold a candle to the previous game, Battle for Bikini Bottom, but it’s so far a decent follow-up nonetheless.

Conclusion:

If you love platformer games like Crash Bandicoot, and are a fan of the SpongeBob animated series, then it’s a no brainer that you have to play this game, even with its quirks and missed opportunities. A fun 3D platformer game that is faithful to the atmosphere and feel of the animated series.
