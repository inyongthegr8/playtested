As someone who never played the 90s classics during its heyday but have played, watched, and experienced them as a “retro” game status throughout the recent years, It is quite a delight to finally play the beat 'em up game Streets of Rage 4, the latest installment in the Streets of Rage series after almost 30 years of hiatus.

One of the first things that struck me about Streets of Rage 4 was the art style. The game features hand-drawn graphics with super vibrant colors and detailed backgrounds that are a true delight for the eyes. The character designs are faithful to the original games while also adding some new HD vibrant touches to keep things fresh and pleasing. Each character has their own unique style, fighting moves, and they all look striking in action.

The gameplay in Streets of Rage 4 is smooth and satisfying as far as retro beat ‘em ups go. Players can choose from a variety of characters — starting for four available — each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The combat system is simple to learn but has enough depth to keep things interesting, with a variety of specific moves and combos to master. The game also features a range of breakable weapons and items that players and enemies alike can pick up and use to devastating effect, adding to the fun and chaos.

While there are plenty of callbacks to the original games, such as familiar enemies and environments, the game also introduces new elements. For example, some levels feature interactive elements such as cars that players can use as weapons or obstacles to take cover behind. The game also introduces new enemies with attack patterns and abilities, keeping players on their toes.

In terms of difficulty, Streets of Rage 4 strikes a good balance between cakewalk-easy and frustratingly unforgiving. The game starts off relatively simple, allowing players to get used to the combat system and mechanics. However, as the game progresses, the challenge ramps up considerably, with tougher, numerous enemies; more unpredictable attacks, and more complex levels. It's a satisfying progression that keeps players engaged without feeling overwhelming.

There are multiple game modes in Streets of Rage 4, but the flagship feature is definitely the Story Mode, where players progress through 12 succeeding stages together with a unique boss fight at the end of the stages. At every stage clear, the amount of lives you have resets, making it highly accessible and not too frustrating. Players also have the option to heal their current health points by picking up food items on the ground.

The game also includes a range of unlockable content and hidden secrets to keep players on the lookout. There are additional characters to unlock (more with the DLC), as well as a range of alternate retro costumes and hidden levels. The game also features online co-op , allowing players to team up with friends for some chaotic beat 'em up action. (originally not present, but was added in an updated last year)

So far, Streets of Rage 4 is looking like one of the better premium beat 'em up games to come out on mobile, if not currently the best. If you're looking for a no non-sense gameplay, no pay-to-win or grinding elements, and non-stop action, this might be the ideal game to check out.
