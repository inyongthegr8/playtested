Jujutsu Kaisen: Phantom Parade is finally out now, after a myriad of delays from 2022 to the tail end of 2023, with a limited release yesterday November 21, 2023.

However, the game is only available for the Japan region, and not all VPN services work properly with the servers. What worked for me though is OvpnSpider on Android so you can also try that out (it's free).

1. Download on TapTap

2 Connect via VPN (I used OvpnSpider, not all VPN services will work)

3. Open the game app

4. Let it download the rest of the files (you can disconnect the VPN if it's too slow, it will still continue to download even if the VPN is now disconnected)

5. Play the game (reconnect to VPN again if you previously disconnected to download)

That's it, you can finally try the game. Warning though, the game is strictly in Japanese only, so you'll probably not enjoy it as much if it had proper localization.

Moving forward, Jujutsu Kaisen: Phantom Parade is basically a turn-based RPG gacha games like Fate Grand Order and Naruto Ninja Tribes. Kind of like old school or classic style of visuals/combat, but one that feels refreshing in this day and age full of cel-shaded real-time action RPGs.

The gameplay revolves around assembling a team of characters from the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, each with unique abilities and attributes. The progression mainly involves advancing through the story, farming for upgrades, and acquiring new characters through gacha pulls.

Honestly, there isn't much to do here yet other than continuing to progress through the story and farming for upgrades to pull new characters. So, your enjoyment really depends on how much you love Jujutsu Kaisen and if you are open to experiencing the story again (plus other new story content) in a different medium. My recommendation? Just hope and wait for a global release. You can try it for now, but I doubt you'll find any longevity in it with the constant need for specific VPNs and lack of english localization.
