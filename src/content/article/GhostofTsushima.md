After spending most of the past decade as a PC-first gamer, I finally returned to consoles this year with a PS5 and Xbox Series X. One of the first games I played was \*Ghost of Tsushima (Director’s Cut)\* — and it instantly reminded me what games I've missed in the PS4 era.



\### A Powerful Samurai Tale  

At its heart, Ghost of Tsushima delivers a beautiful, cinematic samurai story. While the pacing can be a bit slow, the writing and presentation carry it through. I rarely ever tolerate unskippable cutscenes, but in this case, I watched every moment without skipping a thing.



The themes of honor, duty, and inner conflict are well-handled, and the atmosphere is consistently immersive. From windswept fields to burning temples, the world never stops being breathtaking.



\### Progression That Feels Earned  

One of the game’s most satisfying elements is how it handles character progression. You’re encouraged to engage in side activities not just for the sake of completion, but because every upgrade, stance, and armor actually helps you survive tougher encounters.



The loop is addictive. Shrines, duels, mythic tales, and even simple exploration keep giving you something meaningful in return. It’s the kind of system that respects your time and rewards your curiosity.



\### Combat That Blends Style and Substance  

Combat in Ghost of Tsushima is slick, satisfying, and more dynamic than it initially appears. You switch between multiple stances based on enemy types, make use of stealth tools, and unlock mythic techniques to stay ahead.



However, I do think there's room for improvement. Enemy behavior and encounter design could use more variety in the long run. Still, what’s here is more than enough to keep things engaging throughout the entire game.



\### Director’s Cut Enhancements on PS5  

Fast travel takes only a few seconds. The SSD makes exploration and traversal a breeze. It’s one of the cleanest open-world technical experiences I’ve played on console.



My only request would have been a cinematic auto-travel mode while on horseback, similar to what Red Dead Redemption 2 or recent Assassin’s Creed games offer. Riding for long stretches manually can get tiring without one.



\### A Few Narrative Gripes (Spoiler-Free)  

There are side arcs that felt like they were building toward something deep — especially one involving a mentor and a former student — only to end without proper resolution. That left me hanging a bit. I also dislike moments when the protagonist is forcibly knocked out in a cutscene just to push the story forward. It breaks immersion when it’s done without proper setup.



One major character also made several choices that came off as frustratingly narrow-minded, even when logic and emotional weight said otherwise. I get the thematic angle, but it could’ve been written with more nuance.



\### Final Thoughts  

By the time you finish the game, Jin isn’t just a samurai anymore. He’s something else — a one-man ninja clan operating from the shadows. If there's ever a sequel, I’d love to see that direction fully embraced, possibly with Jin founding a hidden order to continue the fight in silence.



Ghost of Tsushima is a standout title. It's not perfect, but it has polish, heart, and plenty of memorable moments. A must-play for anyone who missed out during its original launch.



Score: 9/10
