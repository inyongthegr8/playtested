With Halloween just around the corner, Call of Duty Mobile is now coming with a new update set to bring an eerie and action-packed experience to CODM players, with a recent trailer glimpsing of what's to come.

The trailer showcases a transformed Halloween version of one of Call of Duty Mobile’s maps — Standoff, bathed in moonlight, and exuding an ominous atmosphere. A jack-o'-lantern reaper statue, hanging bats, and eerie shadows adorn the map, adding a Halloween twist to the battleground.

The update, called Season 9 — Graveyard Shift, is set to launch on October 4 at 5 PM PT, bringing back fan-favorite modes like Zombies Classic and Undead Siege, along with new challenges and rewards. The Battle Pass includes unique Operator Skins and Weapon Blueprints. The return of Zombies Classic and Undead Siege alone is reason enough to get excited about the update, since zombies have been an underrated highlight of the Call of Duty franchise for years. This update is poised to bolster interest in the game, especially alone with the upcoming Call of Duty Warzone Mobile schedule this November.

As the trailer suggests, players can prepare to battle it out in style within Halloween Standoff and Haunted Hacienda, engage in new multiplayer modes, and unlock rewards. Call of Duty Mobile Season 9 promises to be a captivating and immersive Halloween-themed experience, available as the moon rises on October 4!
