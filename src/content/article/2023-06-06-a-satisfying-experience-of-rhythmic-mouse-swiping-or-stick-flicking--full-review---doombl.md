DOOMBLADE

Doomblade is a 2D platforming metroidvania with unique combat and platforming mechanics, developed by Muro Studios and published by Iceberg Interactive for PC.


**Pros:**


+Feels overall refreshing and completely a brand new experience

+Innovative control schemes

+Amazing art direction


**Cons:**


-The difficulty of using the mouse or right stick for aiming is not for everyone

-Confusing level design

Doomblade, offers a highly unique take on the Metroidvania genre. With its innovative combat mechanics featuring precision-based clicking much like mouse rhythm games like Osu!, or twin stick shooter style of combat when using controllers.

Doomblade features a weird but actually refreshing mix of lightheartedness and creepy demonic undertones. The art direction is simply amazing and refreshing. The cartoonish, stylized graphics are a weird match for demonic themed, flora based landscapes with sci-fi and industrial technologies sprinkled in for good measure, but it actually works and is a refreshing sight to see. Accompanying the visuals is a captivating soundtrack that complements the fractured environment. From metal rock to orchestral tunes, the music captures the essence of each area and encounter, enhancing immersion and setting the mood for exploration and intense battles.

The story follows Gloom Girl, stumbling upon the titular Doomblade, an awakened weapon filled with an insatiable desire to break free from its long-standing chains. United as a formidable duo “Gloom and Doom”, they embark on a vengeful journey to unleash their formidable abilities and eradicate the Dread Lords forever.

Doomblade's gameplay revolves around its precision-based combat highly intertwined with its platforming system, which sets it apart from traditional Metroidvania games. The combat mechanics require players to click enemies or use the right stick for aiming to launch towards it for an attack. This not only applies in combat but platforming segments, requiring players to time the enemies positions to launch an attack, and be able to reach platforms and areas. Without these enemies to “latch” onto with an attack, these areas are otherwise unreachable. This approach immerses players in intense battles and exhilarating platforming segments, creating a sense of fluidity and empowerment.

Starting with basic moves such as jumping and slashing, players gradually unlock additional powers that enable them to attack through walls, dash forward mid-air, slam down, and create their own targets. These abilities encourage creative thinking, precision, reflexes, and strategic use, adding depth to both combat encounters and environmental exploration. The game's boss fights are more of the same, but require even more reflexes and precision, although some require players to decipher riddles or indulge in good old-fashioned button mashing. The variety in boss designs and attack patterns keeps players on their toes, ensuring each encounter feels unique and rewarding.

However, the game's combat system, heavily reliant on mouse input or right stick, may pose challenges for players unaccustomed to precision based clicking or aiming. For the controller, the pinpoint precision necessary to select targets in a group may be compromised as well. Nevertheless, for players who can adapt to the gameplay style, Doomblade provides a satisfying experience of rhythmic mouse swiping, button clicking, and sword clashing that makes each battle a thrilling experience.

Doomblade offers a 2D semi-open world of sorts that encourages exploration and freedom to roam around, although some areas are outright unreachable unless you acquire the necessary skills to be able to reach these areas, such as a mid-air dash, for example. The game uses a save-checkpoint system that reverts your progress back to the last saved location after death.

However, with the game’s freedom comes the caveats: the game occasionally falls short in providing clear guidance on the correct path, leading to moments of confusion and potentially sending players into unnecessary dead ends and back-and-forthing.

While maintaining the core elements that make this genre so beloved, it puts its own unique spin on it that feels overall refreshing and completely a brand new experience. In fact, with enough following, it may even spawn a sub genre on its own down the line.

Conclusion:

While not without its flaws, Doomblade's amazing art direction, engaging gameplay, and innovative control schemes create an enticing package that will appeal to fans of the genre seeking a fresh and intense experience.
