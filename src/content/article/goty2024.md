End of 2024: I wanted to take a moment to look back at the games that truly defined my year. Not just as a list of critically acclaimed titles, but as personal experiences that stuck with me through late nights and memorable moments. These are the games that made me lose track of time, brought out the best in fun, or simply told a story that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.

This list isn’t based on technical benchmarks, public reception, awards, or internet hype. It's about what I actually played, completed, and personally enjoyed. It’s shaped by what got installed and stayed installed. What I kept thinking about. What I wanted to talk about. So, while some big hitters like *Astro Bot* or *Balatro* might be missing here, it’s not because they weren’t great, but simply because they weren’t part of my rotation. At least not yet!

These five games stood out not just for what they did well, but for how they made me feel—whether it was stress, awe, laughter, or that quiet satisfaction of finally clearing something tough. Some are cinematic and polished, others scrappy but surprising. All are worth your time.

Let’s get into it.

  <div>
<strong>Helldivers 2</strong> is a coop shooter with hardcore elements and action-packed cinematic gameplay that kept me busy through sleepless nights and weekends.

A typical team-based shooter on the surface, it surprises with satirical themes, intense progression, and squad-based satisfaction. Few moments top the thrill of surviving a high-difficulty extraction with friends.

  <div>
<strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong> is a compelling turn-based RPG that combines classic tactical combat with fresh mechanics and a captivating story.

The ability to switch character archetypes on the fly opens a world of build possibilities and keeps combat deeply engaging. It’s easily one of the standout RPGs of the year.

  <div>
<strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong> surprised me with its first-person perspective, turning puzzles and exploration into an immersive adventure straight out of the films.

The game captures that classic globe-trotting Indy feel without sacrificing interactivity or clever puzzle design.

  <div>
<strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> expands the Remake’s world with open-area exploration and Synergy Abilities, striking a balance between nostalgia and fresh storytelling.

It’s a bold reimagining that dares to branch off from the original while keeping fans emotionally invested.

  <div>
<strong>Dragon Age: Veilguard</strong> pivots to action-oriented combat reminiscent of <em>God of War</em>, backed by clever level design and a satisfying series finale.

While the art style sparked debate, the moment-to-moment gameplay and narrative beats left a strong impression.

And that wraps it up. Whether it was fighting overwhelming odds, killing aliens or robots in a squad of four, immersing myself in an underappreciate High-Fantasy RPG world, or discovering a whole new world of wonders, each of these titles made this year’s gaming journey feel memorable and worthwhile.

The beauty of a personal GOTY list is that it reflects what stuck with you—not what trended. These were the games I enjoyed the most, the ones I brought up in conversations, and the ones that made me excited to hit “Continue” or "Load Game" after a long day.

Until then—clear your backlog, follow the fun, and play what makes you excited to pick up the controller again. Thanks for reading.
