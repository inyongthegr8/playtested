Temple Run+ which was released for the subscription-based gaming service offered by Apple just recently, is the Apple Arcade version of the game Temple Run, where players take on the role of an adventurer who must endlessly run through the temple, avoiding obstacles, collecting coins, and trying to outrun a group of demonic monkeys chasing after them.

The game is easy to pick up and play, with simple four directional swipes and tilt (gyro) phone controls that allow the player to move left, right, jump, and slide. The game's objective is to run as far as possible, collecting coins along the way to purchase power-ups and upgrades that can help the player go further.

The game's difficulty increases as the player progresses, with new obstacles and challenges introduced at each stage. The game's pacing is excellent, keeping players engaged and constantly on the edge of their seats, while giving them a satisfying feeling collecting coins and garnering points aiming for a new high score. When you die and exhaust all possible revive options, you must reset back from the start and start from zero, except for the powerups and boosts that you’ve unlocked.

Temple Run+'s graphics are noticeably old school as far as mobile graphics go, but it still holds up well as a modern game, especially since the main focus is the endless run gameplay. The game's design is inspired by the architecture and aesthetics of ancient temples, such as seen in films like Indiana Jones or games like Tomb Raider, with intricate details that give the game an authentic “temple adventures” feel.

Temple Run+ is an incredibly fun and addictive game that is hard to put down once you start playing. The game's simple yet challenging mechanics, combined with its ageless visual design, make for a highly engaging and immersive experience.
