With its unique art style, engaging narratives, and various gameplay features, Madtale aims to offer an enjoyable idle RPG gaming experience for players on iOS and Android devices with its recent release last July 12.

Madtale features a captivating plot. With the main protagonist being Little Red Riding Hood, players embark on a journey through a world filled with fairy tale characters like Snow White with intertwined narratives. The game draws players into the intriguing plot and entices them to uncover more about the mysteries of the fairy tale world.

The combat system of Madtale predominantly employs idle gameplay, requiring minimal brain power from the player. The battles are visually satisfying, thanks to the powerful abilities and flashy special effects. It also features upgradable heroes called Partners that are mostly acquired via a gacha system, with unique skills and equippable weapons adds some level of strategy and encourages players to strategize and utilize these powerful skills effectively.

Additionally, the game provides various additional features to engage players. Building up guilds to defeat bosses adds a cooperative element to the gameplay, allowing players to collaborate with others and unlock additional rewards. The Memorial Palace offers plot stories to unlock, adding depth and context to the game's lore. The Arena provides an opportunity for 1v1 combat against real players, giving players some competitive action, while Giantâ€™s Garden, Polluted Prison and Underground Ruins offer a rogue-like experience where players can explore randomized floors, defeat bosses, choose random modifiers, and earn rewards.
