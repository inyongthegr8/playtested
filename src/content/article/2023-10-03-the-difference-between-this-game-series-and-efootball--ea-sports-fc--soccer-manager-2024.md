Soccer Manager 2024 proudly stands apart from FIFA and eFootball in its approach to soccer simulation in video games. While FIFA (Now called EA Sports FC) and eFootball prioritize offering an authentic soccer experience, Soccer Manager 2024 takes a more strategic and management-focused route. Sounds familiar? It might be because this concept is reminiscent of other popular 'manager' games like Football Manager 2023 or Basketball Manager 2023.

Soccer Manager 2024 is tactical and methodical. Matches unfold at a pace that allows you to think strategically, you can pause the match at almost any time, looking at the 2D overview of the match. You'll find yourself pondering over each pass, each substitution, and each tactical adjustment. It's a cerebral experience, and if you're a fan of sports management simulations, you'll find it incredibly satisfying even though the visuals arenâ€™t always in tantalizing 3D or in a fast-paced eye pleasing action.

One major difference is the absence of direct player control in Soccer Manager 2024. In EA Sports FC and eFootball, you can control players' movements with precision, executing intricate dribbles ,accurate passes, and stunning goals. In contrast, Soccer Manager 2024 limits your direct involvement to making tactical decisions and substitutions, albeit in a much more deeper manner. You watch the matches unfold as if you're a coach or manager in the stands rather than a player on the field.

In Soccer Manager 2024, your ability to strategize, make smart transfers, and build team chemistry takes center stage. It's a game for those who relish the challenge of managing a soccer club from top to bottom.
