BRIXITY - Sandbox&Multiplayer

BRIXITY is an innovative sandbox city-building game that invites players to embark on a creative journey of restoration and construction. Set in a world that suffered a collapse five centuries ago, players are tasked with rebuilding Earth using the remarkable BRIX technology.


**Pros:**
- Wholesome gameplay for all ages
- Charming and cute visuals
- Freedom to build custom buildings and structures and share it with the community
- Explore both your own city and those by others in third person


**Cons:**
- Paywalls limit players’ creativity and choices
- time consuming, progression and currency requires real-time waiting


The central gameplay is about constructing structures and building entire cities in top-down view with the help of the amazing technology called BRIX, and then exploring the world and visiting other players in a third-person view. BRIX (as in “bricks”, essentially the building blocks that players can use to create buildings) allows players to create spectacular builds as they wish.

BRIXITY’s artstyle is delightfully charming with a fusion of vibrant colors and whimsical blocky Minecraft-ish design, reminiscent of a children's cartoon or story book brought to video game form. The game world is adorned with lovable details that breathe life into the adorable cities.

The city-building system draws inspiration from the conventional mobile city-builder framework, reminiscent of titles like Clash of Clans or Rise of Kingdoms, albeit without any combat or fantasy elements and with its own unique and charming twist. Players have the freedom to place structures, buildings, and build their city using coins, and slowly reclaim more plots of land as they progress.

At the heart of this progression lies the Earth Restoration Center, which serves as the “Town Hall” of the city, completion of the required missions will allow you to upgrade the center to the next level, thus unlocking additional structures and ways to earn currencies. In some of the tasks, such as upgrading the Center or reclaiming plots of land, players will have to wait in real time for these to be completed.

Players are encouraged to create their own custom buildings, houses, statues, and a myriad of other elements through the intuitive builder menu. By placing individual blocks, they can bring their unique designs to life, bound by only their creativity. However, for those who lean towards a more city-building-oriented gameplay style, they can continue just using pre-made blueprints.

These players can effortlessly choose from a selection of pre-designed blueprints, even utilizing the game's semi auto-piloted assistance to construct these structures via the builder menu. These pre-existing blueprints can be from the game itself or from creations contributed by other players. Additionally, players can collect special BRIX, which players can place in their cities.

The humans are now called Pipos for some reason, and gradually make their way into your city, arriving one by one.. Pipos in turn can be placed in buildings to improve their stats, such as in generating coins every hour. Beyond their functional contribution, they also inject a sense of character and charm into the city's visual aesthetics, as they can be placed in various locations to elevate its overall appearance.

BRIX, the building blocks that form the foundation of the game's creative possibilities, are acquired through a loot box system. Conversely, the introduction of Pipos to your city occurs through a gacha roll system, which adds an element of excitement and anticipation to their arrival. However, it's worth acknowledging that the inclusion of gacha systems, loot boxes, and premium currency can potentially impact players' artistic freedom and innovative capabilities by imposing certain limitations, such as putting cosmetics or upgrades into premium territory. It’s not pay to win per se, but pay to create cooler designs.

Although the combination of city-building elements, Minecraft like block buildings, and the use of gacha rolls for characters are indeed unconventional. The whole mechanic is very well thought off and seamlessly flows with one another.

What I also love about this game is its wholesomeness, there is no combat, no violence, and no revealing waifu elements, resulting in an experience that is universally welcoming to all age groups, particularly children.

The social aspect of the game is where players can customize their Pipos, share blueprints with others, invite others to visit their cities, or personally visit other players’ cities in third person. They can even participate in a mini-quest of hunting for collectibles. Players can also rate other cities to get more rewards. This adds a layer of interaction and personalization to the experience. It encourages players to showcase their creativity and share their achievements with others.

Conclusion:

While the presence of gacha and loot box systems raise monetization concerns and can limit creativity, BRIXITY's commitment to crafting a family-friendly, wholesome environment makes it a welcoming space for players of all ages. Whether creating your own custom buildings, customizing and interacting with Pipos, or sharing creations with the community, BRIXITY offers a heartwarming and innovative take on the city-building genre.
