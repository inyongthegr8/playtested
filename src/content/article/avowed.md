---

I went into **Avowed** with low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much the game offered. While it clearly borrows from the Elder Scrolls formula, it carves out its own identity with strong RPG and skill check elements, tactical combat, and a large, immersive world.

## Pros

- ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical, skill-based combat that requires strategy and timing  
- üé≠ Deep dialogue system with impactful skill checks and roleplaying options  
- üìö Helpful lore and contextual in-game explanations that keep you immersed  
- üé® Impressive Unreal Engine 5 visuals that bring the world to life, one of the best utilizations to date

## Cons
- üé≤ Loot can be inconsistent and frustrating, especially for magic builds  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Combat and progression scaling feel uneven, limiting the sense of power growth  
- üõ†Ô∏è Tedious looting and inventory management that can break immersion

Avowed‚Äôs world is vast and varied, ranging from sprawling ruins and ancient temples to dense forests and bustling settlements. The attention to detail is remarkable, with environmental storytelling woven throughout every location. The visuals are impressive, showcasing some of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 with dynamic lighting, detailed textures, and impressive weather effects that truly enhance the atmosphere.

Combat in Avowed is tactical and engaging. It requires you to pay close attention to positioning, timing, and resource management, especially when using magic or ranged attacks. Unlike many action RPGs that encourage button mashing, Avowed rewards deliberate play and experimentation. However, the scaling system can sometimes blunt the sense of progression, as enemies grow in power alongside you, making even late-game encounters feel like constant challenges rather than moments of triumph.

The dialogue system features impactful skill checks that affect how conversations unfold and how you can roleplay your character. What I appreciated most was the in-game lore and explanations provided during dialogue, which helped keep me grounded in the world without needing to consult external sources.

Looting was a mixed experience. While the game offers a variety of weapons, armor, and magic items, many drops felt lackluster or irrelevant to my build. I found myself repeatedly looting bodies and containers for scraps, which sometimes felt like a chore rather than an engaging gameplay element. It disrupted the pacing and occasionally pulled me out of the immersive experience.

Despite these flaws, Avowed succeeds in creating a rich, atmospheric RPG world that encourages exploration and experimentation. The blend of narrative depth, exploration, and tactical combat kept me invested for over 60 hours.

### Conclusion

Avowed is a solid RPG that shines in exploration, combat, and storytelling, even if it stumbles on loot quality and progression pacing. For players craving a deep, immersive RPG experience with meaningful roleplaying and a richly crafted world, Avowed is well worth your time, especially if you can look past its rougher edges.
