Card Hog - Dungeon Crawler
8.7
Puzzle
Strategy

In Card Hog - Dungeon Crawler, Players control a hero character who has the option to slide in any of the four directions in a customizable grid map setup represented by cards. The character starts with a base health and weapon, and a numerical stat that determines its strength when encountering other cards. Every turn, the character can head to any of the four directions which can either be an empty space, a hazard, an enemy, or an item like weapons and healing potions.

Card Hog - Dungeon Crawler offers an engaging gameplay experience. Although there are multiple game modes, the main mode is structured around a series of dungeons, each with its own layout, traps, and enemies. The dungeons and its cards are procedurally generated, each playthrough will be different, so you can pretty much play endlessly.

When your character encounters an enemy, both your numerical stat that represents the health points are compared with the enemy, bolstered by the number stat of your weapon. The higher numbered stat wins the conflict with points depleted depending on the stat of the enemy defeated. When a weapon stat reaches 0, it breaks, leaving the character vulnerable to damage. However, there are upgrades and healing potions that can restore your HP, or even increase the limit. New weapons can be picked up across the map as well.

As the player progresses through the dungeons, they will encounter boss battles, which are some of the most challenging with their own gimmicks in moving across the grid. These battles require careful planning, anticipation, and execution, and defeating a boss feels like a significant accomplishment.

Speaking of game modes, it features a traditional dungeon crawling system, with visits to a town named Hogsville in between as a reprieve for the players to buy temporary weapons, upgrades, and items from friendly merchants. Card Hog also features an endless mode, one with no breaks to Hogville and the game just continues endlessly until your character dies. There is also a zombie survival mode where the enemies are instead zombies that pop-out of the ground.
