title: Low poly 254 player warfare! | First Impressions - BattleBit Remastered
---

While still in its early access stage, BattleBit Remastered showcases potential for an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience. With its low-poly graphics and immersive sound design, the game aims to deliver a fast-paced and action-packed experience for up to 254 players per server.

BattleBit Remastered introduces players to a destructible environment, allowing for strategic destruction and environmental manipulation. The ability to shape the battlefield adds a layer of depth and tactical decision-making to gameplay. The game supports vehicular combat with a variety of tanks, helicopters, transports, and sea vehicles in some game modes, offering players diverse options for traversing the battlefield and engaging in intense battles.

The class system, featuring Assault, Medic, Recon, Engineer, and Support roles, harkens back to traditional Battlefield games, providing players with distinct playstyles and encouraging teamwork. Additionally, the game offers familiar game modes like Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Rush, which provide a mix of large-scale battles and focused objectives.

The game's progression system allows players to unlock new attachments and gadgets by increasing their kill count and rank. While this system offers a sense of achievement and rewards dedicated players, it may pose challenges for newcomers who find themselves matched against experienced players with a plethora of unlocked gear. This imbalance can lead to frustration, and it would benefit the game's overall experience if the developers address this issue in future updates.

BattleBit Remastered, despite being in early access, demonstrates a lot of potential as a multiplayer FPS. Its unique combination of low-poly visuals, immersive sound design, and large-scale battles creates an engaging and fast-paced gameplay experience. I've encountered occasional crashes when I first initialized the game, but since then, it has worked flawlessly so far, with smooth performances during gameplay.

While there are huge areas for improvement, such as balancing the progression system for new players, more balanced maps, and a more refined matchmaking, the game showcases promising features and mechanics that could capitalize on a market currently devoid of a proper Battlefield-like game. As the development progresses, BattleBit Remastered has the opportunity to refine its gameplay, address player feedback, and solidify its position as a competitive multiplayer shooter.
