Verdurous Holiday, the upcoming expansion for Snowbreak: Containment Zone, unveils a picturesque beach paradise on Yallu Island: a picturesque oasis with tranquil beachesand lush landscapes nestled in the West Patra Sea.

The update offers new outfits like "Sparkling Swell" and "Sultry Sunshine" and introduces Mauxir, equipped with a tactical exosuit and a transforming robot, "Kebechet." . Of course, since this a Summer themed update, the new outfits are swimsuit based and players are in for a treat.

Players will engage in the Ancient Isle Survey, investigating the island's division and the source of the robot attacks while exploring and collecting mysterious tablets. Activities showcased in the trailer include island exploration and fishing. Additional gameplay modes include "Goddrush Pam," a chibi-style party board game, and "Seabound Warfare," a traditional Snowbreak shooter across the archipelago.
