Mojo Melee is a brand new Auto Chess currently undergoing an open beta test for Android, with Season Zero currently underway.

In Mojo Melee, Players choose a leader character known as a Mojo, each possessing a unique set of skills based on the chosen Mojo. Some are focused on defensive buffs, some are healers, and some focus on inflicting damage. Additionally, players must construct a deck lineup of champions to bring into battles.

The fundamental gameplay revolves around a straightforward auto chess mechanic: each round, players are granted 10 gold, and they can use this currency to purchase and deploy from a selection of three random champions or abilities. Following auto chess conventions, strategic placement of units becomes crucial, as it determines the outcome of battles. Proper resource management and clever utilization are also vital aspects of the game.

During my first few minutes of Mojo Melee, while the game is indeed engaging enough, I've encountered a lot of technical challenges that hampered my gameplay experience. The initial loading takes too long (five minutes) so don't worry if you are experiencing that, just wait it out. Once the game loaded up however, the subsequent loadings were much faster.  Also, matchmaking for me is currently unplayable due to the lack of players, so don't expect a lot of multiplayer action for now. Thankfully, I was able to get most of my enjoyable battling AI with the practice mode.

Originally made as a browser game, Mojo Melee also plans to launch another beta test in August for iOS devices, ensuring that people have access to it regardless of whether they're using browsers or phones.
