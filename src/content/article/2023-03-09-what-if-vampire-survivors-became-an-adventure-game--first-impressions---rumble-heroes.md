Rumble Heroes : Adventure RPG’s gameplay is similar to Vampire Survivors; you only control using one hand and you only control movements of the characters, nothing else. However it adds more complexity and depth to the game by introducing various adventure RPG concepts. Traversing through the land, encountering different characters, building your party, and resting in camps and villages.

The combat is fun and satisfying for the most part that compels me enough to play, and it does it without requiring any effort from the player. Players just have to bring the party within attack range, stop moving, and they will automatically bash and hit their enemies to death.

However, it becomes clear that this is a trade-off for some proper skill-based combat, as there is no way to handle enemy attacks but to mostly brute force tank them. There isn’t even a way to reliably control which character goes in front and gets damaged. So if you’re looking for a game that is deep on the active combat mechanics, this is not it.

Players generally control multiple characters at once, and gather more characters to choose from along the way. Or sometimes, in a gacha-like recruitment system. There are many different heroes to gain, from simple axe-wielding joes to full-on rogues and mages

In Rumble Heroes, progression is tied to the series of increasingly difficult areas in the world, requiring you to upgrade your characters and level them up to be able to withstand further locations.

Players will encounter dungeons and quests along the way that gives players another excuse to kill monsters. The dungeons are wave-like and require players to clear all enemies, one level after the next. There are bosses in both the world and dungeons, providing a hefty challenge to players.

Further adding to the already gameplay rich world of Rumble Heroes, there is a bit of resource gathering and minor base building elements while exploring the land, sometimes requiring you to gather wood, meat, and minerals, to be able to perform different actions like activating new structures, revealing locked zones, completing quests, recruiting heroes from the pub, and upgrading them.

In Rumble Heroes, All of these gameplay elements result in a rather engaging dynamic system that seamlessly switches from killing monsters, bosses, to gathering resources and building structures, on a whim.
