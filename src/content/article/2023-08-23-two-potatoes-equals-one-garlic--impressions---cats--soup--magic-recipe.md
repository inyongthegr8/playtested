title: 'Two Potatoes equals one Garlic!?! | Impressions - Cats & Soup : Magic Recipe'
game: 'Cats & Soup : Magic Recipe'

Cats & Soup: Magic Recipe welcomes players to a charming beachside kingdom that oozes with wholesome vibes. The visuals are charming, characterized by a hand-painted art style that invokes the warmth and charm of a beloved children's storybook.

The merging/cooking mechanics involve combining identical ingredients to create higher-tiered ingredients, which are then used to craft the different dishes available in the game once everything is complete. The merging process is reminiscent of a 'match-two' concept seen in games like 2048, which retains that highly addictive aspect. Despite not making any logical sense, where combining two potatoes results in one garlic, and two carrots into one parnish, the system really works well and is very addicting.

As players progress through the game, they unlock new recipes, dish types, mini-games, cosmetics, and ingredients, providing a sense of continual discovery and progression, where players strategically merge ingredients to create more complex and flavorful dishes.

I could not find any in-game purchases yet, but the foundations for premium currencies and cosmetics are already evident. Currently, any form of monetization in this game only comes from ads.  As the game is still in a soft launch state, progression can be reset anytime for now.
