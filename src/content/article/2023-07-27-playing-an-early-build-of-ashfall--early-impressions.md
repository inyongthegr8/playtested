Ashfall is an ambitious MMORPG developed by Legendary Star Studio and NetEase, and is set in a post-apocalyptic world.  Not to be confused from the similarly titled Ashfall, a Web3/NFT game currently in development by Liithos Game Studio. I had the opportunity to try out an Early Build of the game on both mobile and PC, and here are my initial impressions:

-MMORPG set in a post-apocalyptic shooter filled with mutants, robots, and bandits
-Inspired by the Fallout game series with its premise, and the Metro game series with its atmosphere
-Alternates between Resident Evil style third-person shooter combat, and JRPG style overworld map exploration
-Gunplay is satisfying, with emphasis on accuracy and precision over guns blazing
-Features an engaging RPG system with character classes, traits, and skill talents
-Equipment itemization with different rarities
-Talent respecs are totally free and can be done anytime
-Crossplay and cross-progression between Mobile and PC is possible

As first impression, Ashfall shows great promise as a captivating and versatile post apocalyptic-themed MMORPG brim-filled with features and capabilities. It is set to release on PC and mobile next year.
