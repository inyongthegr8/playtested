The Doomsland: Survivors is a top-down shooter with rogue-lite elements that will leave you on the edge of your seat. From the moment you start playing, you'll be thrown into a world overrun by human zombies and other zombified creatures and mutants, and it's up to you to fight your way through hordes of enemies to survive, one room at a time.

The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with the character automatically firing only when stationary. The only control you have is over your movement and a special attack that slowly reaches 100%, which means you have to constantly dodge and weave your way through enemy fire while taking down as many enemies as possible while stopping.

The rogue-lite element of the game adds a layer of difficulty and replayability that will keep you coming back for more. Each time you play, you start with a basic gun and basic attack, and must level up by killing enemies. When you level up, you gain access to three randomized upgrade choices that modify how the game plays. As you progress through the game, the upgrades become increasingly absurd, resulting in a massive bullet hell mayhem that will test your reflexes and quick thinking

There are persistent elements though in the form of gear upgrade and talent systems that ever so slightly improves character attributes and stats. It's a slow grind, coupled with the game's unforgiving difficulty where you are almost always facing hordes of enemies and bullet hell proportions of projectiles, and the inability to shoot while stationary, makes it a very hard game to progress through.

Furthermore, the game's heavy reliance on microtransactions and ads can be a bit of a downside. While the game is free-to-play, players will need to spend real money to progress faster or gain immediate access to certain upgrades and items.

Despite these monetization strategies, The Doomsland: Survivors is still a thrilling and satisfying game to play, especially when you have a cool build going on and your bullets are swarming everyone. It's not for the faint of heart, as the difficulty level is quite high and the bullet hell chaos can be overwhelming at times, even to the point of lagging the performance. But if you're up for a challenge and love top-down shooters and rogue-lites, then this game is definitely worth checking out.
