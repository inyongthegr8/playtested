‚ú®Overview
Polygon Arena: Online Shooter is a fast-paced casual mobile shooter. This team-based deathmatch FPS is all about shootouts with opponents in thrilling battles across a four bite-sized maps: Bank Heist, The Garden, Parking Lot, and Farm House. Featuring a cast of ten characters, each armed with a unique passive and active ability. The game is currently in an Open Beta Test for Android as of writing with many new features added.

üé®Graphics

Polygon Arena features a low polygonal art style. The game's visual design is a refreshing departure from the hyper-realistic graphics that have become the norm in the shooter genre. Polygon Arena's visuals are sleek, minimalistic, and crisp. Every aspect of the environment, from the maps to the character models, feels inspired by either Minecraft or Roblox. The minimalist design allows for excellent visibility, crucial in a fast-paced shooter where split-second decisions matter.

üéÆGameplay

The game features 10 characters and 20 weapons to unlock, collect, and upgrade, along with gear like armors, weapon attachments, and masks. You can equip more than just two weapons during matches.  Each character have their own ability, toxic grenades, turrets, or even COD-esque airstrikes.

The core mechanics are easy to pick up and the gunplay is enjoyable, straightforward, and designed for casual play with room for some competitiveness. Whether hipfiring or aiming down sights, guns fire automatically, eliminating the need for a dedicated fire button unless you turn off the Auto-fire option. However, the aim/fire assist feels a bit too strong and overpowered.

Players can also throw frag and smoke grenades and activate a special ability once the meter is filled. It offers a standard COD-like FPS action but with a more casual and accessible feel. Almost anyone can jump in and play this game easily. However, for those accustomed to games with deep mechanics and a high skill ceiling, it may feel lacking.

Matches are designed to be quick, lasting only around two minutes, making it ideal for both quick on-the-go sessions and low-stress competitive gaming.

üößSome new beta test features

New to this beta test is the League system, where you can rank up by playing more matches, starting from League 1 up to League 6 for now. Progressing through your league will also earn you additional currency and loot. You can also invite your friends and create public and private rooms with each other.

üíµFree-to-play or Premium?

The game is likely designed to become a free-to-play game, as the groundwork for microtransactions is already in place, with an in-game store, premium currency, loot boxes, and passes for acquiring characters and weapon cards for unlocks and upgrades.

üìäOpen Beta Performance

Technically, I found the game to be very stable. It ran smoothly without any crashes on my Snapdragon 888 device. As expected, I noticed that I was playing with bots and in offline mode during the first few matches of my playthrough. Even when I turned off my Wi-Fi, the game and the players in my match continued to fight until I got disconnected when the match ended. Settings wise, there is currently no way to adjust your touch control placement, which is a highly requested feature for mobile games. FPS wise, it seems to support up to 120fps, judging from the graphics settings, but the graphics settings are still locked and cannot be changed as of this beta test.

‚öñÔ∏èConclusion

Simple controls and already a fun and familiar style of gunplay, If you're a fan of shooters or just looking for an casual and simple shooter on mobile, Polygon Arena: Online Shooter is one of the games that you should look out for, or even try right now while the beta test is opening. It‚Äôs clearly in its early stages, but it‚Äôs looking good so far.
