title: CS:GO vs CS2 comparison | Almost every aspect has been revamped across the
  board
---

With CS2, Almost every aspect of CS has been revamped across the board: visuals, presentation, gameplay, mechanics, and connectivity, all while still maintaining that familiar Counter-Strike feel that CS:GO players are used to.

Counter-Strike 2 takes gameplay visuals to the next level. Visual effects across the board have received a makeover. With the introduction of Source 2 lighting and particle systems, everything from water to explosions, fire, smoke, muzzle flashes, bullet tracers, and impact effects looks and behaves in a new and immersive way.

But what has really changed? It's easy to see and say that it has indeed improved a lot, but the best way to compare is to directly showcase the difference between the two games. Fortunately, youtuber GameLight has made such a comparison and has gracefully allowed us to share footage taken from his full comparison video. Special thanks to him!

The revamped visuals also prioritizes readability and accessibility, and the menus and UI has also received a complete makeover. Smoke now behaves naturally, seeping through doorways, windows, stairs, and corridors, creating a more authentic gaming experience.

The best part is, Counter-Strike 2 is just treated as a free content upgrade to CS:GO â€” this means players can easily dive right in with their previous content already transferring to the new update, and newcomers can easily try this game on Steam at no cost.
