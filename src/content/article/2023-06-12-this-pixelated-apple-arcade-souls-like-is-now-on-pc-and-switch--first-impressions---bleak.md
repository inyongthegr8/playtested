In Bleak Sword DX, the protagonist is not the one wielding the titular Bleak Sword; rather, they must seek to destroy the weapon itself. As an unnamed warrior, your task is to lift the curse of the legendary Bleak Sword that has plagued the land for over two hundred years. While the story is not that deep, it serves as a premise and backdrop for the hack-and-slash combat action.

The gameplay in Bleak Sword DX is straightforward, with levels each comprising singular blocks and grouped into 12 chapters. Players must clear each level of monsters and survive waves of enemies. The levels are relatively short, ranging from a few seconds in the early stages to a few minutes in the more challenging ones.

Combat in Bleak Sword DX revolves around kinetic gameplay mechanics and features systems such as dodging, blocking, and parrying, along with a stamina system that is consumed with attacks (but not dodges, making them slightly overpowered). The controls are responsive, and the parrying system is forgiving, striking a satisfying balance. Despite the dodge and parry mechanics feeling a bit overpowered, the enemies' diverse characteristics and attack patterns prevent the combat from becoming monotonous. Some enemies strike quickly, while others require multiple hits to defeat or execute powerful attack combos.

As an enhanced PC/Switch version of the Apple Arcade exclusive, Bleak Sword DX introduces several new features that enhance the gameplay and expand the overall experience, mainly adding three new game modes: A randomized campaign run, a boss run only mode, and an arena wave survival mode. Bleak Sword DX also includes all the original chapters from the base game, as well as three additional DLC chapters.

Bleak Sword DX delivers a visually striking pixel art experience accompanied by an atmospheric sound design. The simplistic gameplay and the ability to continue from the same level after death provide a fair and enjoyable experience. While combat may feel slightly repetitive, the challenging nature and responsive controls ensure an engaging hack-and-slash adventure throughout.
