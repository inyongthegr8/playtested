Kill the Crows thrusts players into a world fraught with danger and overwhelming vengeance. The story follows a gunslinger consumed by the fire of retribution, wandering through the ruins of a forsaken wild west town and attacked by an onslaught of enemies, both regular goons and those with supernatural abilities.

Starting the game, Kill the Crows wastes no time in plunging players into the heart of the action. As a marksman gunslinger, players are tasked with surviving the onslaught of enemies. There’s really not much complexity here other than moving around, shooting, and surviving. That’s not to say the game isn’t challenging; in fact, it's actually ridiculously difficult. You can one-shot basically all enemies, but all it takes to kill you is also one shot—just one unnoticed bullet, and you're down.

No disrespect to Red Dead Redemption 2’s ultra immersive and borderline-simulation qualities, but this game really did a better job of making me feel like an unstoppable deadeye Cowboy, which speaks volumes for its quality. Not only did I feel like a badass cowboy, but at times, I even felt like Cleric John Preston from Equilibrium, utilizing Gun Kata with the speed at which I was aiming left and right, dispatching enemies in quick succession.

One potential issue, however, is that the game can start to feel a bit repetitive over time, especially after several tries that always bring you back to the starting point. The lack of extensive gameplay depth and variety to offset the inherent repetitiveness of roguelite games might be a concern for some players. Nonetheless, if you're the type who can swiftly overcome these challenges and can "git gud" in a short amount of time, then this wouldn't be a problem.
