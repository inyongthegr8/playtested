The combat in Metaphor feels fresh thanks to the unique mechanic that allows your characters to change classes and roles mid-battle. This flexibility encourages experimentation and strategy, keeping battles lively and preventing stagnation.

The story unfolds gradually, building from what initially seems like a standard fantasy narrative into deeper, sometimes mysterious themes. Cutscenes blend traditional storytelling with anime-style visuals that add emotional weight and polish.

Graphically, the game impresses with bright, expressive character designs and beautifully rendered environments. The attention to detail, from footprints to weather effects, enriches immersion.

Some frustrations arise from overly sensitive camera controls and movement speeds, which can detract from the experience. Additionally, the story pacing is uneven at times, with some segments feeling slow or drawn out.

Unlike many turn-based games, Metaphor offers the option to bypass certain battles if your characters are strong enough, reducing grind and making for a smoother experience.
