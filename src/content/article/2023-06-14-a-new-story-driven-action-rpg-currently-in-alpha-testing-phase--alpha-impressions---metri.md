Metria is an action RPG currently in development for mobile devices. It is currently conducting an Alpha test from June 13, 2023, to June 20, 2023 and players are free to test out this title. Since this is an Alpha test, expect this to be in a very early state, and not even close to playable and enjoyable.

Metria features cel-shaded, anime inspired graphics and a storyline that is actually gripping and worth tuning in for, based on my first impressions. It doesn’t look as visually impressive as other high-end similar games, lacking in many things such as motion blur, fluid effects, and an expansive open-world to explore. The graphics are already decent enough for its current early state, but it’s not without its current visual issues which are to be expected.

The game plays as a third person hack-and-slash, with seamless character switching consisting of a party of three. Since this was a test phase, I was already able to try out other characters even though they had not appeared yet in the story. It features your traditional character tropes usually seen in these kinds of games, each with their own set of skills and playstyles: swordsman, spearman, mages, archers, etc.

The combat feels a bit stiff, with unresponsive controls and animations that aren't fluid and don't mesh well with each other. However, it has all the flashy and over-the-top moves and skills, which are expected from a hack-and-slash RPG game. This is probably a temporary limitation, but for some reason, in some areas, you can control the camera horizontally only, no looking up or down.

The world is set to feature a huge map that is separated into instances of open areas where monsters of varying levels populate the landscape. This means that every time you switch areas, you are presented with a loading screen. They are pretty quick, but long enough to be annoying after going through a handful of times and realizing you have to continuously go through them — especially when partaking in missions and quests.

Overall, this game shows a lot of promise with its gripping story coupled with its hack-and-slash gameplay, but I don’t like loading screens and how stiff the combat is currently. Judging from my first impressions, it seems that Metria is probably a few solid years away from completion.
