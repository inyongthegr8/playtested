Monster Hunter Now

Monster Hunter Now is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game that integrates the Monster Hunter universe with real-world locations. Developed by Niantic, the same company behind the global AR hit Pokémon Go, this game allows players to use their smartphones to interact with a virtual overlay of the Monster Hunter world superimposed onto their real-world environment.

📌Pros and Cons

📌Pros and Cons

In Monster Hunter Now, players explore their surroundings to locate, track, and engage with various monsters and creatures from the Monster Hunter series. (13 monsters for now) The gameplay involves hunting monsters, gathering resources, and engaging in fast-paced sub-minute battles. How does it fare to mainline Monsters Hunter games, as well as its bigger AR brother, Pokemon Go?

📖Story

📖Story

Monster Hunter Now actually introduces a unique narrative by coming up with an explanation as to how the Monster Hunter universe gets mixed with our actual world, paving the way for the crossover. Of course, it involves a lot of hand waving and “unexplained events” to pull off, but at least the acknowledgement is there. For what it’s worth, they actually made an effort in the narrative, even though it isn’t as deep as the mainline games.

🎨Graphics

🎨Graphics

Visually, Monster Hunter Now impresses with detailed monster models and animations that are probably on par with console Monster Hunter games, and it also ran well on my Snapdragon 888 phone, with the option to enable 60fps mode during combat. The AR overlay seamlessly integrates the virtual Monster Hunter universe into real-world locations, creating an immersive experience, although some street view photos will blend better than others.

The Art Style retains the signature Monster Hunter aesthetic, making monsters instantly recognizable to fans of the franchise. Overall, the graphics and art style contribute significantly to the game's success in creating a believable and engaging Monster Hunter AR world.

🎮Gameplay

🎮Gameplay

Playable in predominantly portrait mode (landscape is available for combat only), the core gameplay of Monster Hunter Now revolves around exploration, hunting, and combat in an augmented reality setting. Players use a perimeter of their real-world location as a hunting ground for tracking monsters, gathering resources, and engaging in fast-paced battles. The battles are super quick — just around a minute, usually less — only just a fraction of what it would take to combat the same monsters in the mainline game, but it's that way for a reason, as Monster Hunter Now is designed to be a game that people will take on-the-go: On walks, jogs, commutes, car rides, etc.

The integration of real-world environments into the gameplay offers a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the game features a progression system with a small variety of weapons and armor to collect and upgrade, giving some sense of growth and achievement. Lighter weapons offer the advantage of swift and agile attacks, while heavier weapons demand precise timing and deliberate strikes to unleash potent and devastating blows.

While the traditional gameplay may not replicate the full depth of traditional Monster Hunter titles, it excels in delivering an engaging AR adventure tailored for mobile devices. There are also other features tailored for the location-based gameplay, such as the paintball mechanic that allows players to mark rare monsters as they pass by your location, either actively or passively (even when you aren't using your phone), as well as the Wander items that essentially extend the range of your available hunting grounds.

🕹Controls and Combat

🕹Controls and Combat

The controls in Monster Hunter Now are user-friendly and accessible, making it easy for players to navigate the augmented world and engage in battles. It’s as basic as it can be, with simple taps and swipes for attacking and dodging that are reminiscent of popular mobile titles like Infinity Blade, providing an intuitive and mindless combat experience. The controls effectively cater to the mobile platform while maintaining a sense of interactivity and engagement during battles.

📜Monetization

📜Monetization

Monster Hunter Now employs a freemium model, allowing players to make in-app purchases using premium currency (gems) for items and progression boosts. While there is some pressure to spend real money, especially since the game doesn't offer extensive content beyond the core gameplay loop, it's possible to enjoy the game without frequent purchases, especially for those who tend to move around a lot.

However, for those who tend to stay in one spot to play, there is an added pressure to purchase the Wander Orb, which can increase the perimeter of your hunting area. Beyond that, it can get a bit boring if you don’t move a lot.

Premium currency can be used to double resource rewards and expedite progress, but the game offers an auto-regeneration of HP and doesn't force players into constant purchases.

⚖️Conclusion

⚖️Conclusion

Monster Hunter Now successfully combines the Monster Hunter universe with augmented reality gaming, creating an engaging and immersive experience for players that can cater both fans and newcomers. While it may not replicate the depth of traditional Monster Hunter titles, it excels in delivering a unique location-based adventure filled with iconic monsters. How much of that will translate into a worldwide success remains to be seen. You cannot deny that Monster Hunter is a popular brand, particularly as a portable game that started with the PSP and continued with the Switch. However, that’s still no guarantee because its overall popularity is still miniscule compared to the whole Pokemon Franchise.
