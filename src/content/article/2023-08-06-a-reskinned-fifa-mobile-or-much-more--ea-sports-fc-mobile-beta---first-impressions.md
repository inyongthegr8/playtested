EA Sports FC 24
8.7
Sports
PvP

EA Sports FC Mobile has entered beta right now in limited regions, just over a month before its official release. I was fortunate enough to try out two of its main game modes as well as explore a bit the game’s mechanics, such as acquiring new players, customization of your club, and soccer team.

Visually, EA Sports FC Mobile impressed me with its improved graphics and smooth animations. Player models are detailed, animations are almost lifelike, and the stadiums are immersive. The only thing that didn't impress me is the 2D-looking crowd detail, which is actually fine but is sometimes unflatteringly shown by occasional bad camera work during action replays.

While not as detailed as the console versions, especially with the upcoming next-gen EA Sports FC 24, EA Sports FC Mobile still manages to impress with its visuals. In terms of options, there is an extensive graphics customization setting that ranges from Power Saver to Ultra graphics, as well as up to 60 fps option for capable devices.

When players begin, they will start with a basic team composed of low-rated players. The game also provides a basic tutorial to familiarize new players with the touch controls and basic gameplay mechanics.

For a mobile soccer game, the touch-based controls are intuitive, enabling players to perform passes, tackles, shots, and skill moves with relative ease. The game offers multiple control options, allowing players to choose between virtual buttons or gesture-based controls, ensuring that everyone can find a suitable playing style. The matches are fast-paced and action-packed, making it ideal for quick gaming sessions on the go, although it's worth nothing that the game strictly requires an internet connection to be able play.

The two core game modes are VS Attack and Head to Head, which will be very familiar for fans of the previous FIFA Mobile games, as it's basically the same gameplay format entering this new franchise name change. VS attack is a real time indirect battle between your team and the opponents, as both teams rush to score more goals against the defending opposing team controlled by AI. The fast-paced nature of these matches adds an adrenaline rush, and the short duration of each half makes it perfect for quick gaming sessions on the go.

In contrast, Head to Head is a direct battle between your team and opponents, with both teams competing directly and playing both defense and offense against one another in real time. These modes are playable in either unranked or ranked mode, which are both available in the beta already.

The core aspect of EA Sports FC Mobile's progression revolves around building a Soccer Team. Players collect player cards through packs, events, and the in-game market. As they acquire more player cards, they can improve their starting lineup and overall team rating.

As a free-to-play game, EA Sports FC Mobile does incorporate in-app purchases, allowing players to acquire virtual currency or packs for faster progression and acquiring top-rated players. While the store and many of the monetization features such as season passes are currently locked for the beta version, past experiences with the FIFA mobile series have been relatively generous with its free rewards. Still, some players may feel tempted to spend real money to improve their teams. Additionally, quests, leagues, events and campaigns provide varied challenges, rewarding players with unique items and players for their accomplishments (all of which are currently locked or are available in limited form only)

If you’re wondering why FIFA Mobile is being rebranded to a new franchise called EA Sports FC, It’s because EA Sports and FIFA revealed last year that their long-standing licensing agreement would come to an end on December 31, 2022. Still, this new iteration will retain its extensive collection of football licenses and adopt the same gameplay format, as even more evident with its mobile version, which for all intents and purposes, looks very much similar to last years’ FIFA Mobile but with graphical improvements, reskinned UI, and new name.

For existing players of FIFA Mobile, the transition to the EA Sports FC version will be seamless. The game will be available as an update on the App Store or Play Store, allowing players to continue their football journey without losing their progress as such as account names and various unlocks and purchases.
