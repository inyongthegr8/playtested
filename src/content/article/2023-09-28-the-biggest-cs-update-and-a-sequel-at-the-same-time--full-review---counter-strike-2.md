- Revamped and improved menu and game presentation
- Quality of life improvements
- Massive visual upgrades
- Game-changing smoke mechanics
- New tick-rate system for better online connectivity


**Cons:**

- No mention of a “revamped” solution to further combat cheaters


Compared to Counter Strike: Global Offensive, or CS:GO, Almost every aspect has been revamped across the board with CS2, while still maintaining that familiar Counter-Strike feel that current CS:GO players are used to. Perhaps what’s better (or worse, more on that later), is that Counter-Strike 2 is just treated as a free content upgrade to CS:GO — this means players can easily dive right in with their previous content already transferring to the new update.

🔀A Seamless Transition
One of the most remarkable aspects of Counter-Strike and Valve is its commitment to its players and fans. It's essentially a free content upgrade that seamlessly integrates with your existing hard-earned cosmetics, ranks, and progression. However, this essentially deletes CS:GO from existence. Unlike CS: Source and the original CS 1.6, both of which you can still play anytime whenever you want on Steam, CS:GO will effectively be superseded by CS2 in all aspects, including the Steamapp id, page, and installation folders. There IS a workaround to revert its version back to CS:GO though, but only for demo viewing and test purposes.

🎨Source 2 Engine visual upgrades (It’s been a long time coming)
Counter-Strike 2 takes gameplay visuals to the next level. Visual effects across the board have received a makeover. With the introduction of Source 2 lighting and particle systems, everything from water to explosions, fire, smoke, muzzle flashes, bullet tracers, and impact effects looks and behaves in a new and immersive way.

🅱️The revamped visuals also prioritizes readability and accessibility, drawing inspiration from recent competitive shooter titles like… dare I say, Valorant. Crucial details like bullet impacts at a distance and directional blood impacts that gradually fade provide players with essential information as they navigate the battlefield. This visual overhaul enhances the gameplay experience, ensuring that every move and shot is more defined. This also extends to the color palette used, which are more vibrant, light, and easier on the eyes, at least for me.

💥The environmental effects in Counter-Strike 2 — explosions, fire, C4 lighting, and more have been reimagined using the Source 2 Engine as well. The result is an incredible visual fidelity and consistency that gives a better sense of immersion, while also catering to the eSports oriented nature of the game with regards to prioritizing visibility and accessibility over pure realism. I find it very well balanced.

📜The menus and UI has also received a complete makeover. Fresh visual effects are scattered throughout the HUD, the presentation is also dialed down to 11 and fully geared towards providing a better competitive experience for both players and spectators alike, both in-game and outside the game. These trivial and minor details make the game look better but also effectively communicate important game state information. Even the buy menu is different now, and again dare I say takes inspiration from newer titles. (I can now refund weapons after an accidental buy, FINALLY)

🏢Total maps makeover
Maps are the lifeblood of Counter-Strike, and Counter-Strike 2 doesn't disappoint. The overhauled maps have been seemingly rebuilt from the ground up, leveraging the power of the Source 2 tools and rendering features. The maps have been upgraded with new Source 2 lighting, creating a realistic world filled with detailed materials, lighting, and reflections. With the maps, they have achieved a perfect balance of feeling familiar to old players while still feeling fresh and brand new.

🔫 Weapons also get a makeover
Weapons are at the heart of the Counter-Strike experience, and Counter-Strike 2 elevates them to a new level. All stock weapons have received high-resolution models, enhancing their visual appeal. Some weapon finishes take full advantage of these new models, delivering a fresh and exciting look. Every shot fired and every weapon wielded is now a visual spectacle. Your CS:GO inventory and cosmetics seamlessly transitions to Counter-Strike 2 too, benefiting from these visual improvements. Will the market value of these weapons change? Well let’s hope it does so I can sell some of my skins.

🚬Smoke not only gets a makeover visually but also mechanically
Smoke grenades in Counter-Strike 2 are no longer boring. They've become dynamic volumetric objects that interact with the environment, responding to lighting, gunfire, and explosions. This opens up exciting new tactical possibilities, as bullets and grenades can temporarily clear sightlines or manipulate smoke for strategic advantage. Smoke now behaves naturally, seeping through doorways, windows, stairs, and corridors, creating a more dynamic and competitive atmosphere.

📶Sub-Tick Updates for a better online connectivity
Tick Rates have always been the bane of CS:GO’s matchmaking servers, only going up to 64 ticks, which mean it’s less accurate and reliable than the usual 128 tick server rates used in high-level play and external matchmaking platforms like FACEIT.  Counter-Strike 2 now introduces sub-tick updates, revolutionizing server responsiveness. Unlike traditional tick-based systems, sub-tick updates ensure that motion, shooting, and grenade throws are evaluated with pinpoint precision to the thousandth of a second. This means that regardless of the server's tick rate, your gameplay will always feel responsive and consistent.

🎯Cheaters? Prime is still here
While there’s no info about any improved anti-cheat measures aside from the usual measures like VAC, CS2 will still have Prime matchmaking, which helps significantly reduce the presence of hackers and cheaters within the game. This comes at the cost of essentially dividing the playerbase into free-to-play players and “Prime” players. Prime costs $14.99, and if you had this already with CS:GO, it will just carry over to Counter-Strike 2.

⚖️Conclusion
Valve still can’t count to three, but it’s perfectly fine with Counter-Strike 2, a much needed revitalization of the still popular but declining series. Featuring stunning upgraded visuals, enhanced gameplay mechanics, quality of life improvements, and backwards compatibility with your hard-earned CS:GO items.
