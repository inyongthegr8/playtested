The central mystery of Strange Hill revolves around your enigmatic neighbor, Dr. Wood, and his assistant Gloria. As you uncover their secrets, you'll find yourself embroiled in age-old conflicts among feuding clans and even traveling between worlds.

The gameplay primarily consists of a third-person platformer, with elements of stealth and shooter gameplay, although the these aspects are only lightly explored. You'll explore the town itself, take on different quests, including the main story.

While the game is free to play, it does offer in-app purchases for items and skills, but the game doesn't pressure you to spend money excessively. It's entirely possible to finish Strange Hill without making any purchases, although the game is also filled with ads which can be quite annoying.

With its endearing characters, lighthearted short-lived narrative, and promise of ongoing updates, Strange Hill offers a charming experience that currently --- sits at about over an hour for the main campaign. It's pretty short, so might leave some players craving more content. However, the developers have promised regular updates and extensions, which could address this issue and provide a reason to return to the game in the future.

Currently, Strange Hill has recently made its debut on Android and iOS, with a PC (Steam) release coming soon.
