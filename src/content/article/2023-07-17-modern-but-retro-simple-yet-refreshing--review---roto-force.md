Roto Force

Roto Force is a retro-inspired twin-stick shooter that turns the genre on its own with its unique take. Instead of moving around the levels freely, you move around the inverted planet-esque environment. You move around the level like a hamster on a wheel and try to avoid enemies that usually spawn at the center. Despite it being retro in its aesthetics and soundtrack, the gameplay couldn't be more modern with its fluid touch-based controls and movement mechanics.

As a new intern at Roto Force, you’ll go on missions through the game’s variety of worlds and environments, battling different kinds of enemies and bosses. The pixel art style captures the essence of retro games, and the monotonous and somewhat limited color palette adds a touch of genuine retro authenticity to the experience. Accompanying the visuals is an energetic and catchy soundtrack that perfectly complements the fast-paced gameplay.

Roto Force's gameplay mechanics set it apart from other twin-stick shooters. As mentioned before, instead of freely moving around levels, you move around an inverted planet-like environment, reminiscent of a hamster on a wheel, and you must constantly maneuver to avoid enemies spawning at the center. It's a refreshing twist that keeps the action literally centered on the screen.

Aside from moving left and right around the level, the character can also aim and dash around the circle by swiping up with the left stick. It may be a little confusing and difficult to do at first, but it becomes second nature pretty quickly. In line with the dash mechanic, bubbles will occasionally appear to protect enemies, as well as health and weapon pickups that need to be dashed into to become accessible.

Additionally, the character can aim with the right stick and shoot projectiles at enemies, with the manner of attack determined by the weapon type. In the demo I've played, there are only two kinds of weapons: regular rapid fire and homing rockets, both of which are equally effective. Overall, the controls in Roto Force are straightforward and easy to grasp. However, the gameplay itself offers a unique experience that I haven't encountered in any other game before.

After progressing through the levels and encountering a variety of enemy types including mini-bosses, the end of each chapter lies a boss fight. These boss fights are fairly challenging but nothing seems unfair. They all have certain movesets and animations that, once figured out, will prove to be easy. It may initially seem like just another rogue-like game, but it's not. Dying in Roto Force is not unforgiving; instead, it reloads you back at convenient checkpoints, providing players with the opportunity to easily retry boss fights and levels, without starting from scratch. It's not a very complex game in terms of mechanics and progressing, but it's mindless fun nonetheless.

During my experience with the early access demo, I had the opportunity to play the first level, defeat its boss, and try out two different weapons.. In the full version, which has now been released this July 18, players can look forward to accessing a total of 9 unique weapons, 30 challenging mini-bosses, and 10 epic bosses. They have also included generous accessibility options to cater to a wide range of players. These options include the ability to slow down the game speed, increase damage output, and even grant infinite health.

Conclusion:

Roto Force offers a refreshing gameplay experience with its rotating world mechanic and engaging touch-based controls. With its retro aesthetics infused with modern mechanics, Roto Force combines the best of both worlds, delivering a thrilling and challenging adventure for players.
