**Aliens: Dark Descent** delivers on intense, squad-based tactical combat in a dark sci-fi setting that fans of the franchise will appreciate. However, its frustrating level design, lack of formation control, and immersion-breaking bugs sometimes pull the experience down.

## Pros

## Cons
- 🗺️ Annoying level design with inconvenient blocked paths and detours  
- 🤖 No control over unit formation, limiting strategic flexibility  
- 🐛 Occasional immersion-breaking bugs, like enemies shooting through walls  
- ⚔️ Damage output and enemy toughness sometimes feel unbalanced  
- 🕹️ Minor UI and control quirks hamper smooth gameplay

The game throws you into claustrophobic, hostile environments where every move matters. The level layouts often force you on long detours around broken bridges, locked doors, or barricaded hallways, which can be predictable but also frustrating when objectives are just within sight. This design choice adds tension but occasionally feels like padding.

One major tactical limitation is the inability to set squad formations or control who moves first. This is especially problematic when using snipers, who often end up poorly positioned behind teammates and unable to use their skills effectively until the whole squad moves forward. It’s a frustrating design that sometimes forces suboptimal tactics.

The enemy designs are excellent, with gruesome alien creatures and fearsome demons that look and feel threatening. The gore effects add to the grim sci-fi atmosphere, immersing you in the horror of the environment.

However, the difficulty balance can feel off. Sometimes, even large squads struggle to quickly dispatch enemies, especially human foes who soak damage, while other times the game feels easier. Certain bugs, such as enemies shooting through walls, break immersion and occasionally cause mission frustration.

Gameplay overall blends influences from classic tactical shooters and modern strategy games, resulting in a combat system that is deep but occasionally clunky due to UI and control quirks.

### Conclusion

Aliens: Dark Descent is a solid tactical squad game that captures the dark sci-fi horror of the franchise with intense combat and a gripping atmosphere. Though hampered by level design frustrations and some technical issues, it provides a challenging and rewarding experience for fans willing to overlook its flaws.
