Not to be confused with Hearthstone's Tavern Brawl game mode, Tavern Brawls is an unrelated brand-new mobile game that combines elements of Hearthstone's card gameplay and Auto Chess's automated resolution of battles into one engaging mash-up. It has recently been released on a soft launch for Android and iOS.

Tavern Brawls' gameplay features a card battle system with tactical and resource management elements. Players choose a hero character to lead the battle, each with their own unique characteristics and modifiers.

The fundamental gameplay revolves around a straightforward mechanic. In each round, players are granted an increasing amount of gold, which they can use to purchase and deploy randomized cards with their own characteristics, offensive and defensive ratings. Strategic placement of units becomes crucial, following the conventions of auto chess, as it determines the outcome of battles. Proper resource management and clever utilization of card effect synergies are also vital aspects of the game.

I was only able to try the Fight game mode, which is singleplayer against bots. The progression is tied to ranking system and becomes increasingly difficult almost immediately. By the Silver rank, the difficulty spike becomes so high that it's almost impossible to gain all the trophies in a match. However, overall as a first impression, the combat is engaging, fun, and offers strategic and varied card battle action.
