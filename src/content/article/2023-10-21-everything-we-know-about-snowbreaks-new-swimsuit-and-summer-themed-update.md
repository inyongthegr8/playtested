Fresh from its recent update last month, "Fogbound Dream", Snowbreak: Containment Zone is about to get even fresher, quite literally, with its new content update called "Verdurous Holiday".

This tropical-themed update promises a refreshing change of scenery and gameplay, introducing Yallu Island, a mesmerizing beach paradise that will challenge players with mysteries and adventures.

üå¥A Tropical Escape

The new expansion transports players to the pristine shores of Yallu Island, a picturesque oasis nestled in the West Patra Sea. With its tranquil beaches, lush landscapes, and inviting azure waters, it's no wonder Yallu Island has become a world-famous vacationers' paradise, often referred to as the "Verdure Star of the Sea." I didn't know what Verdurous meant before this announcement, but now I know it means green and lush, and this update surely is.

But this vacation is not your typical relaxing getaway. As operatives from Snowbreak's Heimdall Force embark on a well-deserved holiday, they stumble upon the ruins of an ancient civilization. The island's pristine beauty is contrasted by its enigmatic secrets.

üëôNew Content and Features

Verdurous Holiday introduces a range of new content and features, including outfits and rewards such as Yao Winter Solstice‚Äôs ‚ÄúSparkling Swell‚Äù and Enya Murphy‚Äôs ‚ÄúSultry Sunshine.‚Äù  The outfits look sexy, amazing, and surely a treat for fans of the game.

The highlight of this expansion is the introduction of a new character, Mauxir - Shadow Ka. Mauxir wields a tactical exosuit equipped with a tactical robot module. The connection between Mauxir and the robot, "Kebechet," grants them the power to transform, offering unique combat capabilities. Mauxir can swing "Kebechet - Sacrifice" at enemies, causing it to explode upon impact and deal damage. Judging from the trailer and subsequent reveals, the character is indeed interesting.

üé£New Activities?

"Verdurous Holiday"

While exact details on all the activities included in the expansion remain unknown, the official trailer for Verdurous Holiday provided a sneak peek into what players can expect. Island exploration seems to be a significant focus, with breathtaking vistas awaiting discovery. The trailer also teased fishing as one of the confirmed activities, as well as a board game like mini-game.

üéâParty Board game?

"Goddrush Pam" is a gold-grabbing party game jointly developed by Ramses Group and Fujiwara Entertainment. Players will have the opportunity to compete against others in this entertaining board game mode, offering a unique twist to the Snowbreak experience.

Seabound Warfare, set on the island, will offer traditional Snowbreak shooter gameplay. Players will undertake a series of trials across five islands, each promising valuable pearls as rewards. Teumessian, a notable character from the Snowbreak universe, is set to make an appearance in this action-packed mode.

Verdurous Holiday is set to release on November 2, 2023 and expect more details to come soon as we approach the date. Stay tuned for more updates, and prepare to escape to Yallu Island's Verdurous Holiday and have some much needed refreshment.
