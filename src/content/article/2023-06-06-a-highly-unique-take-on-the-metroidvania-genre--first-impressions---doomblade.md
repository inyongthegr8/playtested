Doomblade, offers a highly unique take on the Metroidvania genre. With its innovative combat mechanics featuring precision-based clicking much like mouse rhythm games like Osu!, or twin stick shooter style of combat when using controllers.

Doomblade's gameplay revolves around its precision-based combat highly intertwined with its platforming system, which sets it apart from traditional Metroidvania games. The combat mechanics require players to click enemies or use the right stick for aiming to launch towards it for an attack. This not only applies in combat but platforming segments, requiring players to time the enemies positions to launch an attack, and be able to reach platforms and areas. Without these enemies to “latch” onto with an attack, these areas are otherwise unreachable. This approach immerses players in intense battles and exhilarating platforming segments, creating a sense of fluidity and empowerment.

Starting with basic moves such as jumping and slashing, players gradually unlock additional powers that enable them to attack through walls, dash forward mid-air, slam down, and create their own targets. These abilities encourage creative thinking, precision, reflexes, and strategic use, adding depth to both combat encounters and environmental exploration. The game's boss fights are more of the same, but require even more reflexes and precision, although some require players to decipher riddles or indulge in good old-fashioned button mashing. The variety in boss designs and attack patterns keeps players on their toes, ensuring each encounter feels unique and rewarding.
