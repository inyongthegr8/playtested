unVEIL the world is a tactical hero summoning RPG that immerses players in an epic narrative centered around a massive tower. Within this colossal tower is where the characters take on formidable challenges. As players venture deeper, they unravel the mysteries of a world only accessible to those who dare to enter.

The renowned manga artist and illustrator Posuka Demizu, known for "The Promised Neverland," has lent her artistic talents to the game's character designs, adding a unique and visually captivating element. The protagonist, Yuta Lassica, takes center stage in this intriguing premise.

The graphics, faithful to Demizu's signature style, blend the charm of HD-2D inspired visuals with high quality cel-shaded 3D graphics, promising a refreshing and visually stunning gaming experience. Of course, the collaboration with Posuka Demizu ensures that the characters are visually captivating, and the use of cel-shaded 3D graphics adds a refreshing twist to traditional art style or HD-2D visuals.

Developed jointly by NetEase Games and Shueisha Games, unVEIL the world was first announced at TGS 2022. Not much is known about the game since that initial announcement, until today’s Tokyo Game Show 2023 trailer which added a small drop of new information.

Looking at the trailer, which mostly showcased beautiful presentation with music and visuals, actually showed blink-and-you'll-miss-it footage of the tactical RPG gameplay. It seems that the game will be played vertically or in portrait mode, with cards of heroes at the bottom and the gameplay action front and center. We are probably looking at a turn-based or semi-turn-based combat system here, judging by how the units are positioned. Before that part in the trailer though, we probably lowkey already saw the actual battle animations for the main characters that are going to be used in combat. Once again, still not much is known, and we are left with a crumb of game details to talk about.

However, as with other similar games in the market bearing the category of tactical hero summoning RPG game, it’s safe to expect that we’ll be seeing a free-to-play game with gacha mechanics. Tactical hero summoning RPG mobile games usually combine strategic team-building with turn-based combat, hero collection mechanics, and a variety of modes and challenges to create an engaging and often long-lasting live-service game experience.

As with these games, players will build a team from their hero roster, which are collected by summoning using in-game currency or special summoning items. These heroes come with various rarities and abilities, and collecting a diverse roster is a key aspect of the game. These games often have a story or campaign mode where players progress through a series of levels, battles, and missions, interconnected with a narrative that unfolds as players advance. The huge tower shown in the promotional videos will surely play a central role in the story mode and its missions.
