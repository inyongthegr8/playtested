title: An Exquisite Return to Form | Ghost of Tsushima (PS5 Director’s Cut)
game: Ghost of Tsushima
---

After primarily gaming on PC for most of the past decade, I finally returned to consoles with a PS5 and Xbox Series X. One of the first games I tackled was **Ghost of Tsushima (PS5 Director’s Cut)** — a title I’d missed after the Xbox 360 era but heard so much praise about.

## Pros
- ⚔️ Deep, varied combat styles and stances that keep fights fresh  
- 🌄 Beautiful, handcrafted open world with immersive atmosphere  
- 🧩 Meaningful side activities that reward exploration  
- 🚀 Insanely fast ~3 second fast-travel loading times on PS5  
- 🎭 Storytelling with strong narrative quality and emotional depth  

## Cons
- 🐴 No auto-pathing or cinematic horse travel like in RDR2 or recent AC games  
- ⏳ Story pacing is a bit slow at times  
- 🤦‍♂️ Some story moments feel unresolved or frustrating (e.g. Ishikawa and Tomoe arc)

**Exploring the world of Tsushima is a sublime experience.** The game’s open world isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a character itself. From the golden fields of grass to misty forests and snowy mountain peaks, every environment feels lovingly crafted. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle add layers of immersion. Watching Jin ride across the landscape on horseback while the wind sways the grass is genuinely poetic. It evokes the feel of classic samurai cinema, something this game wears proudly on its sleeve.

The combat system is a highlight and a joy to master. Jin’s arsenal includes a variety of fighting styles and stances, each effective against different enemy types. From the powerful Stone Stance for armored foes to the swift Water Stance for agile opponents, the game encourages tactical thinking. The addition of Ghost weapons and stealth tactics lets you choose how to approach battles, whether head-on or silently. While the combat mechanics are already strong, I believe there's room to deepen the combos and move variety in a potential sequel.

Character progression feels rewarding without being overwhelming. The game subtly motivates you to seek out side quests and activities to gather resources and unlock new techniques. This design works well because the upgrades feel impactful and worth pursuing, rather than just busywork. It’s one of the few games that makes side content feel like an integral part of the experience instead of a chore.

One of the most impressive technical feats is the PS5 Director’s Cut’s **fast travel system**. Fast traveling loads in about three seconds—almost instantaneous—and really helps maintain the pacing, especially in a game where exploration and movement are core.

The narrative carries an emotional weight that kept me invested despite some pacing issues. The story unfolds slowly, giving time to build atmosphere and deepen characters, but at times this slower pace tested my patience. Jin’s journey from samurai to “Ghost” raises interesting questions about honor, sacrifice, and change.

I had a few nitpicks, mostly minor but worth mentioning. For example, Jin’s uncle, an important character, struck me as frustratingly narrow-minded at times. It felt like he represented an inflexible mindset, clashing with Jin’s evolving philosophy. Also, there’s a moment where Jin is knocked out during a cutscene — a trope I usually dislike because it removes player agency and feels forced.

Perhaps my biggest story disappointment was the Ishikawa and Tomoe subplot. The game builds tension around their relationship and conflicting loyalties, but it ends abruptly with little resolution. I expected a deeper exploration of their motives or a more satisfying payoff, but the game seemingly just forgot about it.

### Conclusion

**Ghost of Tsushima** is a masterclass in blending cinematic storytelling with open-world exploration and nuanced combat. It captures the spirit of samurai films with a heartfelt narrative and breathtaking environments. While not without flaws—such as slow pacing and unresolved story threads—it offers a deeply rewarding experience that few games in the genre can match. For fans of samurai stories and atmospheric adventure games, this title is an essential play. If the series continues, I’d be eager to see Jin embrace his “Ghost” persona fully and maybe even lead a ninja clan, expanding on the fascinating world the game has built.
