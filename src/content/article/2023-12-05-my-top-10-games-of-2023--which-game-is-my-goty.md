title: My Top 10 Games of 2023 | Which game is my GOTY?
---

It has been a wild ride for gamers throughout 2023. From early-year contenders like Hogwarts Legacy and Resident Evil 4 to clutch latecomers like Alan Wake 2 and Spider-Man 2, it's been a very crowded year. A solid collection of masterpiece remakes, worthy innovative sequels, and refreshing new IPs.

With dual Nintendo entrants such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and the out-of-nowhere masterpiece Baldur's Gate 3, this is perhaps one of the greatest years for gaming in recent times. Most of these games could easily win Game of the Year if released in another year.

As the year ends, it's my pleasure to present to you a collection of titles that have defined this year in gaming. Unlike conventional countdowns, our Top 10 games of 2023 are not constrained by the order of quality, reflecting the wild and unpredictable ride this year has offered. Note that this is mostly limited to the games that I reviewed here on TapTap... the good news is, I've reviewed a LOT of games, and played a whole bunch more.

Hogwarts Legacy
8.8
6K Want
Action
Adventure
An early 2023 contender, Hogwarts Legacy faithfully captures the atmosphere of the Wizarding World, and creates a fantastic Hogwarts experience with a gripping story in-line with the lore and gives us a world full of wonder and magic. The RPG elements might be a little too light and the world is not as sandboxy as one might expect, but overall, it is a masterpiece that lives up to the hype and THE quintessential Harry Potter game we’ve always dreamed of.

Dead Space

Action
Adventure
Dead Space Remake is another hit in the series and a return to form with its immersive and atmospheric gameplay coupled with a decent story that built and improved upon the original. Tailored to both long-time fans and newcomers alike, it is a masterful example on how to remake a classic game and leverage genre maturity and modern technology to make it even better. 

Now I’m torn between wanting a proper remake of Dead Space 2 and 3, or a full-blown Dead Space 4. Maybe they should take the Capcom route and just do things simultaneously.

Resident Evil 4Global
8.8

Editors' Choice
Action
Resident Evil 4 is definitely a worthy remake of the original game, and perhaps the best remake Capcom has put out so far. Simply a beautiful reimagining of a classic masterpiece that manages to raise the bar even higher for remakes in general, and proves to us that even a masterpiece such as 2005’s Resident Evil 4 can still benefit from some improvements. Unless you get spooked so easily by its survival horror themes, this is a game that I would highly recommend to all fans of the action-adventure genre, and definitely a must-buy for any Resident Evil fan.

Starfield
9.1
496 Want
Action
Realistic
Starfield offers an expansive and immersive RPG experience. Its captivating graphics, awe-inspiring soundtrack, and dual first / third-person gameplay contribute to a sense of being in a living, believable universe. The game's vast open worlds, space exploration, and outpost building provide numerous activities to engage in. 

The game itself is already wide and massive, and players can expect hundreds of hours of gaming even well beyond the main story. With more than a thousand planets to explore — albeit many of them barren and empty — there’s plenty of room for growth in both via modding and future expansions. Absolutely worth playing if your system can handle it.

Sea of Stars
9.5

Editors' Choice
Adventure
The only one I was not able to write a review about, but nonetheless deserves a spot on this list, is Sea of Stars. It stands as a shining testament to the potential of retro-style indie games. Sea of Stars successfully modernizes the genre, earning acclaim for its visuals, soundtrack, and gameplay. It not only pays homage to the past but also carves its own place as a modern classic, offering players a memorable and immersive experience in a vast, interconnected universe.

Alan Wake 2
9.3
693 Want
Horror
Story Rich
Alan Wake II an ambitious game that manages to deliver on its ambitious goals, offering an innovative and terrifying experience executed with confidence and expertise built from years of experience. The sequel retains the essence of the original game while expanding its scope and narrative complexity. Sure, the pacing could be a little bit better, but the game's survival horror elements, combat system, and progression mechanics are well-implemented nonetheless, making it a modern classic in the horror genre. The game introduces intriguing meta-narrative elements, further enhancing its appeal to fans of Remedy's previous works and the Remedy Connected Universe.

Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
9.0
26K Want
Editors' Choice
Action
Spider-Man 2 swings into action with the weight of high expectations and delivers an experience that doesn't disappoint. The game's story and premise offer a captivating experience that balances the superhero personas of Peter Parker and Miles Morales with their personal lives, providing a richer and more emotionally resonant experience. As said earlier, Spider-Man 2 is not just a sequel; it's a continuation of a beloved series that builds upon its predecessors in all the right ways. It's a game that respects the legacy of the character while introducing new elements to keep players engaged and entertained. Even at $70 and the potential cost of buying a new console, this game is undoubtedly worth swinging into your gaming collection.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (NS)

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is another masterpiece that sets an even higher standard for open-world gaming. With its boundless exploration, creative gameplay mechanics, and a masterful emergent storytelling, it is an experience that will leave players in awe for years to come. Whether you're a longtime fan of the franchise or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play for the Switch and a testament to the magic of video games. A potential GOTY for 2023.

Super Mario Bros.™ Wonder

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a delightful, whimsical, and mind-bending experience that pushes the boundaries of what a 2D platformer can be, both for you and your friends. In a gaming world filled with endless quests and artificial rewards, Wonder stands out for offering a different kind of satisfaction – the joy of playing itself. It's likely Nintendo's swan song for the Switch, and they're certainly leaving with a masterpiece of a bang, before the potential launch of their new console next year.

Baldur's Gate 3
9.4

RPG
Fantasy
Last but definitely the best, Baldur's Gate 3 is a monumental achievement in the realm of RPG gaming, solidifying its place among the genre's masterpieces and delivering an experience that bridges the gap between real-life D&D and video games. The complexity of its systems, alongside its vast world and intricate storytelling, creates a rare and fulfilling gaming experience that leaves players yearning for more. 

As my personal Game of the Year, It is truly the quintessential cRPG and Dungeons & Dragons game, and a benchmark for those who aspire to follow in its footsteps.
