The House of Da Vinci 3 has come to PC and it is so far an impressive port of a mobile game. Set in the Renaissance era, you play as Giacomo, series protagonist and a friend of Leonardo da Vinci in a puzzle solving adventure across space… as well as time.

The story drops you right after the ending of the second game, and doesn’t provide any explanation or plot to the player (it happens a bit later via scattered letters and notes) and jumps straight right into the tutorial after the quick intro.

The gameplay consists mostly of point and click mechanics. Picking up items across the environment, dragging them around in the inventory, trying to combine them and applying them to the environment. Interacting with highly detailed objects and intricately animated contraptions such as levers, locks, and advanced mechanisms. Solving challenging puzzles that become more complex as you progress deeper into the game.

While the main core gameplay is the point and click puzzle solving element, the main star of the game is the tool you have —- Oculus Perpetua — that allows you to travel across time and into the past version of the room you’re in, where you can change things in the past that will affect the present time. Highly reminiscent of the same puzzle mechanic that appeared in two of my favorite games and levels; Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2.

Compared to the mobile version, House of Davinci 3 features updated graphics that is more in-line with PC gaming standards. Textures are higher detailed and there are more and better lighting effects making it more realistic.

Overall, this port is impressive and it never really felt like a mobile port at all. A highly recommended game if you’re a fan of The Room style puzzle solving games, especially if you have also played the first two games that are also available on PC.
