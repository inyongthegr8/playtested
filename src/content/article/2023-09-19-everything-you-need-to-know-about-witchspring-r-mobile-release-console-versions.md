ðŸ“–Background on the Series and the Original Game

WitchSpring R (The R stands for "Remake/Remaster")  is part of the WitchSpring series, which was initially developed for mobile platforms by Korean game developer Kiwi Walks. Suyoung Jang, the lead developer, played a pivotal role in crafting the first three games in the series. Notably, the WitchSpring series adopts a player-friendly approach, offering buy-once titles devoid of in-game microtransactions or DLCs. Players make a single purchase to access the full game, including future updates, all without intrusive ads or premium currency to buy.

The original WitchSpring 1, released in 2015 for mobile devices, laid the foundation for the series' engaging storytelling and immersive gameplay. WitchSpring R is set to revisit and revitalize this classic, bringing a fresh perspective to the cherished tale.

Just like the original, WitchSpring R emphasizes storytelling, with a focus on Pieberry's relationships with other characters and the unfolding narrative that uncovers the secrets of her world. Players can help Pieberry grow and become a more powerful witch by engaging in various activities like potion-making, combat, and exploration. The game utilizes a turn-based combat system where players strategically choose spells and actions in battles against different foes

If WitchSpring R is anything like the original game, it will also feature multiple endings. Players will find themselves faced with a time limit of 100 in-game days, and the decisions they make during this time significantly impact the outcome of the game. In total, there were nine distinct endings to discover, each offering a different conclusion to Pieberry's journey.

WitchSpring R appears to be an intriguing remake of the original WitchSpring 1, offering a blend of storytelling, character development, and gameplay elements. Aside from upgraded graphics and full controller support, WitchSpring R also introduces many quality of life features compared to the original 2015 game:
