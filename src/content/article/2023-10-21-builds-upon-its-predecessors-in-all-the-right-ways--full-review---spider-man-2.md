Spider-Man 2 --- actually the third installment in the Marvel's Spider-Man series, swings onto the scene with high expectations and boy it delivers. Following the success of Marvel's Spider-Man and the enjoyable spin-off, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which is one of the first games I reviewed here on TapTap, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is not just another sequel but a progression of the series that builds upon the solid foundation laid by its predecessors.

I reviewed here on TapTap


**Pros:**


+Balanced emotional storytelling with Peter, Miles and their supporting casts and villains
+Seamless character switching between the two Spider-Men
+Satisfying Spider-Man mechanics: Swinging and Combat
+Engaging character progression: unique abilities and gadgets for both characters
+A wide range of accessibility and visual options, from swing assists to 60FPS


**Cons:**


-Back are the boring unskippable non-superhero stealth missions that disrupt the fun
-Totally a missed perfect opportunity for co-op play

‚≠êÔ∏èScore: 9/10

üìñStory and Premise

Spider-Man 2's narrative doesn't hold back, thrusting players into an action-packed intro that's nothing short of breathtaking. The story takes place in the same continuity as the previous games, and it's centered around Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they grapple with personal challenges while facing new and formidable threats. Additionally, the narrative delves into Peter's past, shedding light on his early days as Spider-Man, adding more depth to his character already established in the first game as a seasoned Spider-Man.

One of the central antagonists in this installment is Kraven the Hunter, who leads a private militia and turns New York City into a hunting ground for super-powered individuals.  The other major threat comes in the form of the Venom symbiote, which bonds itself to Peter Parker and exerts a dark influence on him. This dynamic adds an intriguing layer to the story, putting Peter's personal relationships at risk and intensifying the struggle against a powerful extraterrestrial force that we are all familiar with.

The game's narrative approach is masterful in maintaining a balance between the superhero personas of Peter and Miles and their personal lives. Players get a deeper look at their characters as friends, partners, a son, mentor, and student. It's not always about being Spider-Man; sometimes, it's about being Peter or Miles.  The game dives into each character hero; supporting cast, or villain and takes time to show their human side. This human element is one of the game's strengths and contributes to a richer storytelling experience.

üé®Graphics and Art Direction

Graphically, Spider-Man 2 maintains the high standards set by its predecessors. The visuals strike a balance between realism and comic-book stylized character designs. New York City and its added new surrounding boroughs are finely detailed, providing an impressive backdrop for the game's open world setting. Swinging through the towering skyscrapers is an exhilarating experience, and the day-night cycle adds depth and atmosphere to the city.

Character models are intricately designed and detailed, with both Peter and Miles moving with incredible fluidity and realism. This attention to detail extends to the various Spider-Man suits and their unique designs. The combat animations, web-swinging mechanics, and even simple actions like character stopping from a running motion are executed beautifully.

The game supports raytracing on the PlayStation 5, enhancing the visual experience with improved lighting and reflections, although honestly, its really not that noticeable and not big of a deal. A big deal however, is the addition of a performance mode that allows for a smooth 60FPS experience. A literal game-changer, making the transition from the previous PlayStation generation to the new one a leap forward in performance and visual fidelity.  It is for this reason that I shamefully never played the first two Spider-Man games on the PS4, and waited until it is on the PC/PS5 to be able to play at 60FPS. Luckily with Spider-Man 2, the game now supports 60FPS right out of the bat.

üéÆGameplay ‚Äì if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but maybe improve it

The introduction sequence is immediately action-packed and doesn't skip a beat. I literally got goosebumps while playing through the initial set piece, which could even pass as a climax in other games. It also clearly showcases the power of the PS5's SSD with the amount of city panning and fast traversal it seamlessly executes.

Gameplay in Spider-Man 2 sticks to the tried-and-true formula established by the first two games, with several subtle improvements and enhancements. At its core, the game is about embracing the dual roles of Peter Parker and Miles Morales as Spider-Men.

The game is essentially a case of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' which is evident because the first game is already a masterpiece. While some animations remain the same or are just slightly tweaked, this is understandable since a character wouldn't just change his entire moveset just because he‚Äôs in a new game. However, there are indeed new animations added for various actions, including swinging, fighting, and finishing moves. Both Spider-Man characters have their own distinct movesets and have been improved upon compared to the first two games.

The option to seamlessly switch between Peter and Miles at almost any point in free roam ‚Äî- similar to the style of GTA V‚Äôs multiple characters ‚Äî- basically doubles the gameplay variety, as both characters offer unique abilities and gadgets. Add to that the symbiote suit for Peter that introduces a dark twist to his moveset, so might as well make that triple variety.

The implementation of having two Spider-Men characters in the game is exceptionally well done. You can seamlessly switch between Peter and Miles at almost any point while in free roam. Loading is extremely fast, as evidenced by the 1 second fast travel. It loads in just about one second, regardless of your location on the map or where you choose to fast travel to. It's nearly instantaneous. Additionally, you can occasionally encounter the other Spider-Man on the map fighting crimes and provide assistance.

üï∏Who needs a 1 second fast travel when the swinging is this good?

The web-swinging mechanics remain as thrilling as ever, allowing players to traverse the city with agility and grace. The addition of Web Wings to glide throughout the air on both Peter and Miles' suits is a game-changer, enabling them to glide across the city especially across the river to transfer between islands. The wind tunnels and environmental elements add depth to traversal, making it an essential part of the experience. Players can also surf temporarily across the surface of the river if they have enough momentum, ensuring that the traversal experience is as smooth and accessible as it can be despite the huge gaps between islands.

üìü New abilities and gadgets

The game levels the playing field for Peter and Miles by introducing new abilities and gadgets for Peter, which balance with Miles' electricity and invisibility powers. In this sequel, many of Peter's previous gadgets have been replaced, leaving him with just four; however, the game compensates by providing four abilities simultaneously. While each Spider-Man can equip only four powers at a time, they will unlock at least eight (two choices per slot) during the campaign. Peter wields both his mechanic spider-arms and the symbiote suit, while Miles relies on his venom powers. Additionally, both Spider-Men have their own sets of costumes to unlock and wear, and each costume offers various color variants, significantly expanding the roster.

The wide range of unlockable abilities and mods for the web-shooters offers a sense of personalization. Players can experiment with different playstyles, from stealthy takedowns to all-out brawls, depending on their preferred abilities and gadgets.

ü•∑The boring parts

I was never really a fan of the first game's minor side missions and puzzle segments, especially those that involve on-rails stealth and non-suit gameplay, and they're back here once again. For example, playing as a young Peter Parker sneaking his way into his school in a flashback scene or the stealth segments involving MJ. While these sequences have been slightly improved with faster mobility, they still bring back traumatic memories of mediocrity in an otherwise masterpiece title. They do provide a nice break from the action-packed gameplay of being Spider-Man and add some gameplay variety, but I feel that they disrupt the pacing and overall enjoyment too much. Fortunately, there is some minor relief as you can choose to skip at least the puzzle segments once again if you prefer.

‚ôøÔ∏èAccessibility

Many accessibility options are available, and there are even new optional gameplay features, such as the ability to turn off Swing Assist, which provides a challenging swinging experience akin to the classic Spider-Man 2 game for the PS2. The game also offers an option to slow down gameplay down to 30%, resulting in some rather cool and cinematic moments. In the first game, we had to use our photo camera to manipulate the game into slowing down time.

‚öîÔ∏èCombat

In the combat department, Spider-Man 2 builds on the existing Arkham-inspired system with refinements and new elements. Both Peter and Miles can now parry physical attacks, a welcome addition instead of purely relying on dodges. As a result, on the enemy‚Äôs side, there are now certain enemies that cannot be dodged. The gadgets have received upgrades, including mods for web-shooters that allow for new strategic possibilities. For example, players can cast a Web Line across pillars for added footing during stealth sequences, which is particularly useful for performing Stealth Takedowns on multiple enemies.

Each Spider-Man has their own skill tree as well as a shared general skill tree usable for both, which includes unlockable abilities tied to their experience level. Both Spider-Men exhibit fluid and acrobatic movements, which are visually impressive and satisfying to execute. The addition of the Venom symbiote for Peter brings unique abilities and a darker edge to his fighting style, adding a layer of complexity to battles. The combat system maintains the fun and fluid nature that fans of the series have come to love while introducing meaningful improvements that keep battles fresh and exciting. If you‚Äôre an expert combatant in the first two games, then this game will feel very similar.

üï∑üï∑Be Greater. Together‚Ä¶ the greatest missed opportunity of this game.

However, given that the Spider-Men angle is executed very well, I can't help but think that this represents a missed opportunity to introduce optional co-op play to the game, even if it's in a limited capacity, as it wouldn't work for story missions. Even for activities like free roam or an entirely separate co-op campaign, similar to games like Far Cry 4, this could have elevated the game to new heights. Imagine one player assuming the role of Peter and another as Miles, collaborating in a cooperative manner. This is certainly something that has never been done before in a Spider-Man game and is entirely feasible in today's console generation. It's one of those rare instances where it would have not only made sense but also aligned perfectly with the game's theme of 'Be Greater. Together.' ‚Äî Maybe in a future spin-off?

Conclusion

Spider-Man 2 swings into action with the weight of high expectations and delivers an experience that doesn't disappoint. The game's story and premise offer a captivating experience that balances the superhero personas of Peter Parker and Miles Morales with their personal lives, providing a richer and more emotionally resonant experience. As said earlier, Spider-Man 2 is not just a sequel; it's a continuation of a beloved series that builds upon its predecessors in all the right ways. It's a game that respects the legacy of the character while introducing new elements to keep players engaged and entertained. Even at $70 and the potential cost of buying a new console, this game is undoubtedly worth swinging into your gaming collection.
