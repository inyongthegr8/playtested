Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly
8.7
Adventure
Casual

Set in a rainy, mashed up, fantasized alternate 2023 version of Seattle, Coffee Talk lets you play as a barista in the eponymous relaxing coffee shop that serves a diverse range of customers in a world where humans, elves, orcs, and other fantasy creatures coexist with each other. It is highly reminiscent of the premise of the Netflix film Bright.

Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly continues the same gameplay setup of the first game, while introducing new ingredients and minor gameplay elements, like a lost and found drawer and the ability to give items to customers along with their ordered beverage. They’re simple additions but add a lot to the immersion of being a Coffee shop owner.

The gameplay of the game is simple and in some ways repetitive, but highly mesmerizing that you’d want to do it again and again. Your main task is to prepare and serve the drinks that your customers order by selecting the right ingredients based on their requests, or descriptions. Some can be straightforward, some are more vague, some will even allow you to experiment. Learned recipes are saved to your phone and can be viewed for reference at all times.

For the majority of the experience — outside the coffee-making elements — the game is laser focused and brim-filled with stories of customers. Nothing really significant or world changing, but mostly just provocative slice-of-life conversations that just fits perfectly with the coffee themed aesthetic of the game.

Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is not a full-on sequel that tries to revolutionize the series. It is rightfully titled Episode 2 as it mostly retains the same art style, graphics, gameplay, and narrative direction with only minor additions to the recipe. A welcome addition, and one that doesn’t needlessly change the ingredients for good reason.
