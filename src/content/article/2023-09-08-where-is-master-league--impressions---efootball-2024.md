eFootball 2024 is the latest yearly iteration of the eFootball series, which was previously known as Pro Evolution Soccer (PES), released for mobile devices, PC, and consoles. The base game is free-to-play, but eFootball 2024 generates revenue through microtransactions. Players have the option to spend real money within the game to purchase various in-game items and content.

The game offers a pretty realistic simulation of soccer, with attention to player movements, ball physics, and tactical depth. I played the mobile version in which the graphics have always taken a deep dive compared to the photorealistic console and PC counterparts, but they still look decent, especially when everything is zoomed out and the graphics are set to 'High' settings.

Speaking of content, it looks like it has also continued its deep dive further. It features two core modes: Authentic Team and Dream Team. Authentic Team is the traditional football game mode where you can select any current roster and pit them against each other, play with friends, or go offline versus AI. Dream Team on the other hand focuses on building your team via grinding, microtransactions, and competing online.

The game as a whole lacks extensive content. There's no Career mode, Become a Legend, or Master League (that was promised to come this year), and the progression is rather limited, mainly revolving around playing quick five to ten minute matches to satisfy your football cravings on-the-go.
