Defense Derby is a simple game to play, monsters attack your square castle, and you have to place a variety of heroes on top of it to effectively survive the waves of enemies marching around and towards your castle gate.

There are two main gameplay modes in Defense Derby, one is a singleplayer “Blitz” mode where you clear increasingly difficult stages with the use of your predetermined Unit and Hero lineup. While the “Derby” game mode is the multiplayer component and is the main star of the game.

In Derby mode, Four participants are given the same waves of enemies that they have to survive. Each participant faces these waves individually, and the last castle surviving wins. The four participants construct a deck of cards every round via “bidding”. They can start with two cards from their selected deck, and then every round a bidding is organized between the players to gain more cards and limit the other players’ cards as well.

Aside from bidding, Defeating a boss monster can grant players an extra card from their deck as well. To increase their chances of winning, players can combine similar units and synergize units depending on their position during conflicts, which adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Players can also reposition their units with a short cooldown, in order to effectively cover all sides while using only a few units.

You can unlock and collect many different types of units and heroes, as well as participate in a gacha like system in order to obtain these heroes. Since this is just a beta test, the whole model is not yet finalized but expect a decent amount of grinding or spending real money to unlock the more rare heroes and units. Still, I feel that Defense Derby will be a fun game to pick up and play without the absolute need to spend money.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
