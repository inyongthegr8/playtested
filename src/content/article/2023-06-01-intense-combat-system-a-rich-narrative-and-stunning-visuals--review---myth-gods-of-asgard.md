Myth: Gods of Asgard is a hack and slash action role-playing game set in Norse mythology, with a visually stunning art style, combat, and a gacha system.


**Pros:**


+Based on norse mythology we are all familiar with

+Stunning comic-book inspired visuals and art style

+Combat is a finely tuned and thrilling intense experience

+Gacha system focuses on powers and summons, not the actual hero characters

+Diverse game modes from singleplayer campaign to asymmetric multiplayer mode


**Cons:**


-over the top and below average voice acting quality

-frame rate drops

Myth: Gods of Asgard takes players on an epic adventure through a familiar world based on Norse mythology. As an action role-playing game, it offers a unique and immersive experience, intense combat system, a rich narrative, and stunning visuals. I was able to try out the Android version of the game, in which a Closed Beta Test is scheduled for June 3, 2023

The game's art style, inspired by the comic books and cartoons, brings the hand-painted Norse mythology world to life with its cel-shaded looking graphics and heroically designed characters

The main story campaign allows players to embody famous heroes from Norse mythology and become an integral part and even change Ragnarök, the cataclysmic event that shapes the fate of the gods. The game immerses players in a world filled with ancient deities, mythical creatures, and larger-than-life battles.

Players can expect to encounter, summon, or even control familiar gods, such as Odin, Sif, and Thor, while also discovering lesser-known figures from Norse lore. Myth: Gods of Asgard features full-on voice acting, though the acting can be a bit cheesy, and the accents may be exaggerated for my personal taste. What I liked from this game is that despite the compelling story, the cutscenes and dialogue are short and are minimal. It jumps straight to the hack and slash actions for the most part.

Unlike other gacha games where the main element is collecting hundreds of heroic characters. There are only five heroes instead, based on Norse mythology that you can unlock and use, including Thor and Siegfried.

The gacha system in Myth: Gods of Asgard revolves around Divine Powers, allowing players to summon mighty gods from Norse mythology for assistance in combat or to receive their blessings, enhancing skill effects. Each hero possesses a unique set of skills, and it becomes crucial to strategically utilize Divine Power to improve combat power and overall gameplay experience. While Divine Powers can be obtained through the gacha system, players also have the option to gradually acquire them by farming shards.

Combat system is simply amazing. Players can perform a combination of normal and powerful attacks, execute special moves, and dodge or dash to avoid incoming enemy attacks. The combat is a finely tuned and thrilling intense experience; fluid, kinetic, flashy, and visually stunning. However, while the combat mechanics are executed smoothly, I noticed there are performance issues that detract from the experience. Constant framerate drops occur when there are numerous effects and units on the screen, even on my Snapdragon 888 gaming phone. It doesn’t help that there are only three settings for the graphics and performance: High Frame Rate, Normal Frame Rate, and Auto.

Myth: Gods of Asgard features a traditional ARPG itemization system where you can gear up your characters with different types of armor and weapons. You can also enhance them with the use of materials. Aside from equipment, the game also features a talent tree where you can increase your character's stats. The items, talent tree, and divine powers are shared by all the heroes and don't need individual gear-ups or skill trees.

Myth: Gods of Asgard offers a diverse range of game modes tailored to different playstyles and rewards. These modes include a compelling main story campaign and an enjoyable pressure-less asymmetric multiplayer called Arena.

The asymmetric multiplayer aspect is done amazingly, with the players able to challenge other players’ characters 24/7, controlled by an automated AI (which I will talk about later on), no need to battle it out with real controller heroes, just their heroes controlled by AI, which, as it may already be evident, heavily relies on the heroes’ stats and not player skill.

For the main story campaign, it revolves around clearing dungeons one after the other, and facing various bosses with their own style of attacks and difficulties. Not only dying can result in failure, but also there is a timer for some missions. Even if you can skillfully avoid enemy and boss attacks and slowly chip their health to death, you will still fail if you take too much time. The boss fight design is the spongy type with too many health points, and by the second chapter you already need to tinker around with the items, talent tree, and divine powers to be able to survive or kill them on time.

A surprising but welcome feature for an actively controlled ARPG game, Myth: Gods of Asgard also includes auto-game mode for idle gameplay and stress-free farming. The AI powering the auto-game mode is competent (the same one used for the asymmetric multiplayer Arena mode), letting you clear missions relatively well. Still, player control is the more superior option.

As a live service game, it includes familiar features like login bonuses, weekly events, in-game purchases and the aforementioned gacha system. In my experience, the free-to-play experience in this game is playable enough for me, especially with the generous free gifts to the player, albeit a little challenging than outright spending money.

Conclusion:

Myth: Gods of Asgard offers an immersive action-packed journey into the world of Norse mythology, providing a range of game modes to cater to different playstyles and preferences. The game's attention to detail in recreating the mythos, combined with its intense combat and captivating art style with comic book style influenced illustrations, creates a visually stunning experience that fans of mythology and action RPGs would undoubtedly enjoy.
