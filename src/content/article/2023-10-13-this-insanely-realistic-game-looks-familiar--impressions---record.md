REC.O.R.D. is a mobile FPS game with ultra-realistic graphics, it use body cam-style first-person perspective, blending seamlessly with photorealistic visuals and animations resulting in terrifyingly lifelike visuals.

If this game looks familiar, it's because it probably is. You might have seen the original inspiration for this tilted Unrecord, which was unveiled 4 months ago to viral acclaim. Both are still unreleased, but REC.O.R.D. beats the original by having an actual playable early test version.

Is it as realistic too? Yes it is. However the visuals aren't as sharp as Unrecord, as there's only so much a mobile phone can do. Visually, it uses the same techniques and styles that result in a photorealistic graphics.

In terms of gameplay, there isn't much here at the moment. There's only one map, an almost non-existent number of players, and the FPS touch controls leave much to be desired. Nevertheless, it's still worth a try, as there's nothing quite like it in the market right now.
