War Thunder Mobile brings the high-octane world of vehicular combat to the palm of your hand with smooth gameplay and impressive AAA graphics. Ground and naval warfare take center stage, without any dedicated aircraft warfare modes.

The aiming mechanics mirror the main game, complete with drop and aim indicators, while adjustable zoom and tracking features enhance precision. Driving mechanics feel intuitive with the translated touch controls, with improved driver behavior and visual arrows around the tank aiding navigation. Observation tools like death cams and enemy hit cams enhance post-battle analysis.

The progression system has been streamlinedâ€”instead of grinding individual vehicles, you unlock lineups of four, leveling them up to unlock more vehicles and ammunition types. This shared lineup approach simplifies the grind and allows players to progress across nations and multiple vehicles simultaneously. The maps also mirror the main game but are slightly modified to cater mobile gaming's bite-sized nature, offering faster-paced battles with increased spawn points and closer starting positions.

So far, War Thunder Mobile definitely delivers an authentic War Thunder experience to mobile devices. Rather than simply porting the game 1:1, it intelligently adapts it for an enjoyable and streamlined mobile gaming experience. Currently, the primary game modes only feature ground and naval warfare, but I hope aircraft will be added in the future, and soon.
