Epic Age is a strategy / civilization management game set in the middle ages, but pools over heroes and civilizations from all across history in an ultimate strategy showdown that features heroes such as Leonidas, Spartacus, Alexander the Great; and civilizations like Persians, Egyptians, Romans, and many more

Epic Age is played on a hexagonal grid, with the player's civilization starting with a single city and one battle group called “squads”. From there, the player must build up their kingdom’s infrastructure, expand their territory, and advance their technologies and culture to become a dominant power. The various structures and buildings take different amounts of real-world time to construct and upgrade.

Players can slowly expand their territory by conquering neighboring hex tiles, one by one. Some tiles will be more powerful than your current soldiers can handle, so you have to carefully pick which tiles to conquer first, while upgrading your troops, city, and technology.

Players typically perform a set of actions or tasks like upgrades, that require a certain amount of time to complete. Once completed, the player must wait a certain amount of real-life time before being able to perform an action again. This wait time can range from a few seconds to several minutes or even hours, depending on the stage of your progression.

Epic Age's real-world waiting time element and daily login bonuses provide a sense of progression even when not actively playing, and the quest-based system acts as a player tutorial to guide players in their progression.

One of the main highlights of Epic Age is the Hero Collecting aspect that functions like a Deck building game, allowing players to recruit over a hundred historical figures like Joan of Arc or Spartacus with differing tiers and rarities. Players can assign them to lead armies, do politics, and more, providing extra bonuses into what they do depending on their attributes. This adds another layer of strategy to the game and encourages players to collect and upgrade their heroes.

Later on, Players will encounter other player settlements on the online world map and can battle it out, players can also join guilds to do politics and form alliances with other players.

The graphics are just amazing for strategy mobile game standards, especially when the heroes are displayed on the screen, with highly detailed character models that beats even many full-pledged PC and Console titles in the level of detail.

At the onset, Epic Age is a highly engaging and addicting mobile strategy game that offers a variety of gameplay elements: hero collecting, empire management, politics, tactical warfare, and role playing — to the point of being too overwhelming at times — but it can keep players entertained and challenged on a daily basis.
