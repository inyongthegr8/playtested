Teamfight Tactics Mobile is set to release in two days (November 22) for the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. This expansion brings one of the best auto-battler experiences to players in countries like The Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. With a focus on crossplay and cross-progression, TFT Mobile allows gamers across various platforms to compete whether you're on PC or mobile.

Released back in 2020 for iOS and Android, just one year after it's original PC release as side-game for League of Legends and subsequent rise in popularity, TFTs successful transition to mobile devices has been well-received, offering a 1:1 port that maintains the strategic depth and excitement of the PC version. TFT Mobile optimizes features for smaller screens while preserving the vibrancy and visual appeal of the League of Legends universe.

In TFT, players strategically assemble teams of champions, each with unique abilities and synergies, on a hexagonal board. The game consists of recruitment phases where champions are purchased, preparation phases for positioning and itemization, and auto-battle phases where teams engage in combat automatically depending on unit composition and placement. It's basically autochess with its own League of Legends twists and unique engaging mechanics.

Overall, TFT stands as arguably the premier competitive autochess / autobattler game available, presenting itself as a noteworthy addition to the thriving ultra competitive gaming landscape in Asia. The game's strategic depth, engaging gameplay, and competitive elements contribute to its status as one of the best in its genre.
