It looks like DOOM is joining the single touch craze these days by releasing their newest title for the mobile platform — Mighty DOOM. A top down action shooter where players control the mini Slayer, battling mini Demons in an arcade style combat with rogue-lite progression and mission structure.

The gameplay is simple: using just one hand, control the mini Slayer to avoid enemy attacks and position shots. His regular shots automatically fire, while the secondary weapons and abilities are manually activated.

In a rogue-lite fashion, players start off with a basic weapon behavior, and proceed to get 3 random choices for upgrades (depending on their weapon equipped) every once and a while once the ability meter fills up. This choice ranges from a simple stat boost such as an increased health or damage; to a more substantial way that changes how the weapons operate, such as adding another projectile, or making bullets bounce out to other enemies. This makes the gameplay a lot more emergent, and can leave the player excited to wait for and choose the next upgrade.

Once players are a couple of stages in and their weapons are abundantly upgraded, the game is at its best — bullets, missiles and lasers are flying, ricocheting between or piercing through enemies, players are gloriously mowing down groups of mini demons with ease in what seems like a pretty artistic display of fireworks. In Mighty DOOM, beauty is mayhem.

When you die, there is a one-time option of continuing the run via an Ad or an in-game currency, after that, players have to reset the whole chapter from start. Not all progression is lost however, as you can upgrade your character, weapons, and gear to get a better chance on the next try.

In addition to the regular top-down shooter combat, there are also awesome stylish takedowns for regular mobs and bosses alike. Once defeated, regular mobs have a chance to be “staggered” that when approached, instantly triggers a takedown that, like the main games, heals the player.

There are a total of eight chapters that get progressively harder to complete, and while it is only eight chapters, the game will still take a considerable amount of time to complete even if there are unlimited energies, due to the difficulty spikes per chapter. The resulting game is a challenging one, with the biggest factor being the ability of players to avoid and withstand enemy projectiles and attacks, which in turn is partly augmented by their level and gear.

Ultimately, despite being in a different genre and it’s free-to-play nature, Mighty DOOM is still a decent DOOM spin-off to play in small bite sized sessions on a daily manner. The combat and rogue-lite manner makes it fun to play, but don’t expect it to keep you busy for hours.

Full Review will be posted soon here on Taptap! Stay tuned!
