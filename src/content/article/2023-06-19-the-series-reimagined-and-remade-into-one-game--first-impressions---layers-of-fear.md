Layers of Fear (2023) is a remake of the original two games plus its DLC introduces a reimagined story, stunning visuals, and a comprehensive package that will captivate fans of the series, while serving as a good entry point for newcomers..

The core gameplay of Layers of Fear is a game of exploration and discovery. As players assume the role of the various artists, starting with the writer and painter, they venture through a dark and foreboding mansion, slowly unraveling the layers of the protagonists’ disturbed psyche. The game's minimalist design when it comes to story progression, quest markers, and navigation enhances the sense of isolation and vulnerability, placing emphasis on atmospheric exploration and storytelling rather than extensive gameplay mechanics.

The game's environments are meticulously crafted, with each room and corridor oozing with a sense of dread and unease. From decaying paintings to the dimly lit rooms, every detail contributes to the haunting atmosphere. The combination of eerie sound effects - the creaking of wood, rats wandering about, unsettling music, and masterful voice acting - elevates the immersion, drawing players deeper into the nightmarish world.

Throughout the journey, players will encounter a series of puzzles and challenges. Some of these puzzles involve finding the appropriate item or piece of information to progress, such as a locked chest or discovering the combination to a locked door. In certain challenges, the use of the antique flashlight, which is obtained early in the game, is required to reveal hidden messages and secrets within the levels.

While Layers of Fear may not rely heavily on combat or traditional survival horror mechanics and the game effectively conveys a sense of psychological terror, there are still direct threats present in the later parts of the story, and you need to use your trusty antique flashlight to burn these threats akin to Alan Wake’s flashlight mechanic.A gameplay element that’s entirely optional — given that you can activate a “Safe Mode” in the settings to emphasize the psychological aspects of horror, immersing players in a narrative-driven experience without the constant fear of imminent danger.

Layers of Fear excels at creating a psychological horror experience that leaves players feeling unsettled and on edge. The game employs a range of techniques, including my not so favorite jump scares, disorienting camera angles, and hallucinatory transitions, to keep players constantly guessing and questioning the characters’ perception of reality. It messes with your head in the most effective and disturbing ways
