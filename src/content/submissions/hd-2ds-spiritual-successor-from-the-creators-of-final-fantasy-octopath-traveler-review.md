This was the first HD-2D game Square Enix developed along with Acquire. This is a good spiritual successor of Bravely Default but this game can be a huge time sink due to eight characters having different stories. Characters you have recruited during the course of your playthrough will scale accordingly depending on the number of travelers you have recruited after. 

You start the game by picking the character of your choosing which is a nice touch and a huge upgrade to the JRPG class system based on your class preference. What I liked about the game itself is that it allows you to have interactions with NPCs that allows you to purchase items that are normally missing through the shops and armorer, inquire to gain valuable information and to be more receptive with certain actions in the field, challenge to a battle to gain item drops that are not normally present through other means of acquiring and guide the NPC which allows the said NPC to be summoned during battles.

This game has a lot of flexibility in terms of exploring the world since you can go to different regions to your hearts content. You can choose to continue the next chapter of the character's tale or choose to explore the rest of the world. Everything else is up to you.

For completionists, you will need to play the game at a slower pace that requires you to analyse all enemies without missing its entries no matter what. Which means, if there is a boss mechanic that changes weaknesses, you must exactly all of its weakness variations.
