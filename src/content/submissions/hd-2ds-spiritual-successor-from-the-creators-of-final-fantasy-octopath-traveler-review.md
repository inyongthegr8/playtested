This was the first turn-based game Square Enix developed along with Acquire. This is a good spiritual successor of Bravely Default because they marketed this game as HD-2D for its graphics but this game can be a huge time sink since the game has 8 characters with different stories. The more characters you have recruited, the higher danger level you are 

You start the game by picking the character of your choosing which is a nice touch and a huge upgrade to the JRPG class system
